Prudence
========

Prudence is a platform on which you can build scalable web frontends and network services.
Server-side code can be written in JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP, Lua, Groovy, or Clojure.
Though minimalistic, Prudence addresses real-world, practical needs, from state-of-the-art
server- and client-side caching to URI rewriting and virtual hosting.

A comprehensive manual is included in this distribution, in the "/reference/manuals/"
directory.

It is also available online, on the Prudence web site:
