Up and Running
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All you need to run Prudence is a JVM: version 7 or above is recommended,
 though 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "version 6"
target "http://threecrickets.com/prudence/download/#jvm6"

\end_inset

 can also be supported.
 You do not need then 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Enterprise Edition
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 nor even a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

JDK
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: Prudence needs only the basic JVM runtime.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two ways to get Prudence: the easiest way is to download the distribut
ion, which includes most everything and is ready to rumble.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Let's do that now"
target "http://threecrickets.com/prudence/download/#distribution"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But Prudence is modular: later on, you may prefer to assemble your own distribut
ion using the 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Sincerity packaging and bootstrapping tool"
target "http://threecrickets.com/sincerity/"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The Command Line
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Actually, the distribution you downloaded comes bundled with Sincerity,
 which we will use to start Prudence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before we do that, let's quickly familiarize ourselves with Sincerity.
 Open a command terminal and change to the Prudence directory.
 We'll call it our 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

container.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 If you're using a *nix operating system, you can run the command as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

./sincerity
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 In Windows it's 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sincerity.bat
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To see a list of all Sincerity commands:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

sincerity help
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, let's print out all installed modules:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

sincerity dependencies
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If your operating system supports GUIs, you can start Sincerity without
 any command to start its GUI (or use the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

gui
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Sincerity command):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

sincerity
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The GUI is useful for visualizing things, but generally the CLI is better
 for getting things done.
 We'll be using the CLI in this tutorial.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The command will print out some version information, tell you which applications
 are installed, and then hold.
 You should now be able to point your browser to 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "http://localhost:8080"
target "http://localhost:8080"

\end_inset

 in order to see the Prudence administration application.
 Or, just go right to 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "http://localhost:8080/stickstick/"
target "http://localhost:8080/stickstick/"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "http://localhost:8080/prudence-example/"
target "http://localhost:8080/prudence-example/"

\end_inset

 to see the included examples.
 Stickstick is an example of an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

AJAX
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 application, implementing sticky notes shared on the web and saved to a
 relational (SQL) database.
 It comes with the 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "H2 database"
target "http://www.h2database.com/"

\end_inset

, so it does not require a separate database server.
 The Prudence Example is more general, walking you through Prudence's basic
 features in all supported programming languages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While playing around with the examples, you may also want to look at the
 logs: they are in the container's 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/logs/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 directory.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

web.log
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is an 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "NCSA-style"
target "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Log_Format"

\end_inset

 log of all web requests.
 By default, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

common.log
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is used for everything else: your own applications as well as Prudence's
 subsystems.
 The logs will automatically roll, so don't worry about them filling your
 storage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To quit Prudence, press CTRL+C.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Further Exploration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Sincerity has 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "its own tutorial"
target "http://threecrickets.com/sincerity/manual/tutorial/"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Of course, you should not run Prudence in a terminal for deployed systems.
 Instead, install Sincerity's powerful 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "service plugin"
target "http://threecrickets.com/sincerity/ecosystem/feature-plugins/#service-plugin"

\end_inset

 to run Prudence as a robustly monitored system daemon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Logging uses Sincerity's 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "logging plugin"
target "http://threecrickets.com/sincerity/ecosystem/feature-plugins/#logging-plugin"

\end_inset

, which is fully configurable.
 You can also use it to centralize logging for your cluster, and even log
 directly to a database, such as MongoDB.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Prudence is built on top of Sincerity's 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Restlet skeleton"
target "http://threecrickets.com/sincerity/ecosystem/skeletons/#restlet-skeleton"

\end_inset

.
 The documentation there applies to Prudence, too.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
First Steps
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You've played with the example applications, and now it's time to create
 your own.
 Let's make a wiki!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

prudence create
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Create a new application using the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

prudence
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Sincerity command:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

sincerity prudence create wiki
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Restart Prudence, and you should be able to see your new application at
 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "http://localhost:8080/wiki/"
target "http://localhost:8080/wiki/"

\end_inset

.
 There's not much to see at this point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Our Application's Subdirectory
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's take a look at our application.
 Its files are all under 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/component/applications/wiki/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the root are three JavaScript files used to configure the application.
 Take a look at 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

routing.js
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

setting.js
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The former defines your application's URI-space, while the latter controls
 its general behavior.
 Note that Prudence's (and Sincerity's) configuration philosophy is to use
 JavaScript wherever possible, which allows for dynamic, flexible configurations
 that adapt to the environment in which they are run.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Resources
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/resources/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 subdirectory is mapped directly to your URI-space, just like most standard
 web servers.
 For example, a file named 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/mydir/myfile.html
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 will be mapped to 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "http://localhost:8080/wiki/mydir/myfile.html"
target "http://localhost:8080/wiki/mydir/myfile.html"

\end_inset

.
 Also like standard web servers, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

index.html
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 will be mapped to the directory itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Actually, you'll notice that our root index is named 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

index.s.html
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 We call that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

s
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 a pre-extension: here, it stands for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

scriptlet,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and tells Prudence that this is a text file that may include one or more
 sections of code called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

scriptlets,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which are delimited by 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

<%
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

%>
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This, again, may be familiar to you: it's similar to how PHP, JSP and ASP
 work.
 (We'll just quickly let you know that Prudence can automatically cache
 these scriptlet pages, with powerful, fine-grained control over fragmentation
 and cache keys, and configurable cache backends.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Under 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/resources/style/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 you'll see 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

site.zuss
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "ZUSS"
target "https://github.com/tomyeh/ZUSS"

\end_inset

 is an extended CSS language, inspired by 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "LESS"
target "http://lesscss.org/"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "SASS"
target "http://sass-lang.com/"

\end_inset

.
 Prudence will automatically recognize the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

.zuss
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 extension and create the CSS for us.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Libraries
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our reusable code is all under the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/libraries/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 subdirectory.
 Specifically, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/libraries/includes/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 contains fragments that can be included into our scriptlet pages.
 You'll see that our 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

index.s.html
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 uses them.
 For example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

<%& '/header/' %>
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\SpecialChar \ldots{}
includes the file 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/libraries/includes/header.html
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Note that included files may have scriptlets in them (and can be cached
 independently).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All the above might seem quite familiar to you, and this is by intention.
 But the files under 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/libraries/dispatched/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 may seem strange: they are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

low-level
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 direct implementations of encapsulated RESTful resources.
 Take a look at 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

example.js
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover, these kinds of RESTful resources are not directly mapped to URIs
 like those in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/resources/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 subdirectory.
 Instead, they are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dispatched
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 using unique IDs.
 In Prudence, this paradigm is called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

URI/resource separation,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and it allows you full flexibility in structuring your code vs.
 structuring your URI-space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We'll get into all that as we go along this tutorial.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Scriptlets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's look more closely at our 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

index.s.html
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 page.
 The scriptlets are executed, while what's outside the scriptlets is simply
 output to the HTTP response.
 You can freely mix regular output and scriptlets:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

<% for (var x = 0; x < 10; x++ ) { %>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

<p>These are 10 paragraphs.</p>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

<% } %>
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are also a few shortcut scriptlets.
 For example, to output an expression:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

<%= x*2 %>
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above is equivalent to:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

<% print(x*2) %>
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also useful is the inclusion scriptlet, which we've already discussed:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

<%& '/header/' %>
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above is equivalent to:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

<% document.include('/header/') %>
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Behind the scenes, Prudence parses 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

index.s.html
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and turns it into JavaScript source code.
 If you'd like to see the generated code, look at the Scripturian cache,
 specifically under the container's 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/cache/scripturian/container/component/applications/wiki/resources/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 directory.
 These generated files are not actually used by Prudence, and only available
 for debugging purposes.
 Disable their creation by configuring 
\bar under

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

debug
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 mode to false (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "settings-code"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
APIs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What is that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

document
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 namespace mentioned above? It's part of the rich, well-documented API provided
 by Prudence.
 Other useful namespaces are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

conversation,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for accessing the request/response, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

application
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for shared application-wide services.
 The complete API reference is 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "available online"
target "http://threecrickets.com/api/javascript/"

\end_inset

, though it can be daunting to start there.
 Instead, continue reading through this tutorial, where we'll explain APIs
 as we go along, and eventually hit the manual: especially important is
 
\bar under
the web data chapter (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "web-data"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
, which goes over much of the interaction with clients.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And remember that you're running on the JVM: the entire JVM standard library
 is available for you, as well as any other JVM library you install in your
 container (using Sincerity or manually).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Hello, World
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's create a new page for our wiki, under our application's 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/resources/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 subdirectory.
 We'll call it 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

page.s.html
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 We'll start simple:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

<html>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

<body>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	<p>Hello, world.
 This page will become a wiki very soon!</p>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

</body>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

</html>
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Browse to 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "http://localhost:8080/wiki/page/"
target "http://localhost:8080/wiki/page/"

\end_inset

 to see it.
 Note that you do not need to restart Prudence if you're only adding or
 changing pages: Prudence will pick up these changes on-demand, on-the-fly,
 and make sure to compile and recompile as necessary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You'll notice that even though the file has a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

.s.html
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 extension, Prudence does not use the extension for the URL.
 This is because that extension is entirely an implementation concern on
 your end: there's no reason for the user to have to see it, nor to have
 it clutter the URL.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also notice the trailing slash: it's 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

page/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, not 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

page
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 
\emph on
Prudence enforces trailing slashes.
 
\emph default
This allows your relative URLs to be clear and unambiguous.
 For example, to insert an image in our page, we could do this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

<img src="../images/logo.png" />
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Without
\emph default
 a trailing slash, you would not need the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

../
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but 
\emph on
with 
\emph default
the trailing slash, it's 
\emph on
necessary
\emph default
.
 If you don't pick one of the two options, handling relative URLs quickly
 becomes messy.
 So why have we decided to standardize on trailing slashes? Because it gives
 you more flexibility: for example, instead of saving our page 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

page.s.html
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, we could have saved it as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

page/index.s.html
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and the 
\emph on
URL would be identical
\emph default
.
 As you will see, the trailing slash principle is used throughout Prudence
 to allow many such conveniences, for both external URLs and for internal
 library URIs.
 You'll see us constantly ending our URIs in slashes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Multilingual
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The application skeleton uses JavaScript (
\emph on
server
\emph default
-side JavaScript; it has nothing to do with the code running inside web
 browsers), but Prudence also supports Python, Ruby, PHP, Lua, Groovy and
 Clojure.
 To use them, you would first need to 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "install them using Sincerity"
target "http://threecrickets.com/sincerity/ecosystem/language-plugins/"

\end_inset

.
 To try this out, let's install Python like so:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

sincerity add python : install
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We could then create a Python scriptlet:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

<%python
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

for x in range(0, 10):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	print x, '<br/>'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

%>
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The low-level APIs are available for all supported languages.
 Here's a Ruby example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

<%ruby
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

def say_hello name
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

%>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

<p>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	Hello, <%= name %>, and welcome to the <%= $conversation.reference %> page.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

</p>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

<%
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

end
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

say_hello 'Newton'

\begin_layout Standard
Not the most exciting wiki, but it works for editing a single page.
 Let's break it down:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "document.require"
target "http://threecrickets.com/api/javascript/?namespace=document&item=document.require"

\end_inset

 is how we import libraries.
 (At least for JavaScript: other languages have other import facilities,
 which you can use instead.) The API will attempt to import libraries from
 your own application's 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/libraries/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 subdirectory first, and if not found there, will use the container's 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/libraries/scripturian/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 directory next.
 You'll notice that we use a trailing slash in the library URI.
 The library URIs also match the JavaScript namespaces: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/prudence/resources/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 matches Prudence.Resources.
 This particular namespace is very useful for working with web data.
 In this case we're using 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Prudence.Resources.getForm"
target "http://threecrickets.com/api/javascript/?namespace=Prudence.Resources&item=Prudence.Resources.getForm"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We're using the 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "conversation.request"
target "http://threecrickets.com/api/javascript/?namespace=conversation&item=conversation.request"

\end_inset

 to find out if we're in an HTTP 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

POST
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 If so, we will extract the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

content
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 form field (as simple text).
 We will then save it as an 
\bar under

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

application.global
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "application-globals"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
.
 These globals belong to the entire running application, and can be accessed
 from any page, for any request.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We then go on to display the content as well as the HTML form for editing
 the content.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Infinite Editable Pages
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above is just a single page: let's multiply it by 
\emph on
infinity
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To do this, we'll configure our URI-space by editing the application's routing.js
 file.
 To the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

app.routes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 dict, let's add the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

app.routes = {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	'/page/*': '/page/'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What this does is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

capture
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 all incoming URLs that begin with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/page/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to our 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/page/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

*
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 at the end of a URI pattern signifies a wildcard.
 Restart Prudence for our routing.js changes to take effect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You'll see that now, indeed, any URL beginning with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/page/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 will take us to our single, lonely wiki page.
 For example, this: 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "http://localhost:8080/wiki/page/test/"
target "http://localhost:8080/wiki/page/test/"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's edit our scriptlet in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

page.s.html
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to make it differ per incoming URL:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

<%
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

document.require('/prudence/resources/')
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

var id = 'page.' + conversation.wildcard
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

if (conversation.request.method.name == 'POST') {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	var form = Prudence.Resources.getForm(conversation, {content: 'text'})
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	application.globals.put(id, form.content)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

var page = application.globals.get(id) || 'This page is empty.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

%>
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And\SpecialChar \ldots{}
 that's it.
 Now any URL beginning with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/page/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 becomes an editable wiki page.
 If that page does not exist it, it will be created.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The only real 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

trick
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 here is the 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "conversation.wildcard API"
target "http://threecrickets.com/api/javascript/?namespace=conversation&item=conversation.wildcard"

\end_inset

, which gives us 
\bar under
the captured wildcard (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "the-wildcard"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Caching
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our above example, we're storing the wiki page content in in-process
 memory, so it's all quite fast.
 However, if we were fetching data from a database server, authenticating
 users, and doing other sorts of heavy lifting, our page would not generate
 so fast.
 By smartly caching our pages we can ensure that heavy lifting would be
 done only when necessary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Actually, talking about speed is a shorthand for the real issue: even pulling
 data from a database is usually very fast.
 The real issue is scalability: increased load on the database per user
 request can limit your ability to support many users.
 Obviously, it's most efficient to do work only when you need it: and that
 simple principle is the most important tool you have for increasing scalability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Prudence does caching 
\emph on
very 
\emph default
well.
 So, though it might be considered an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

advanced
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 topic, it's a crucial one, and worth going over in this tutorial.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's also easy to do:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

<%
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

document.require('/prudence/resources/')
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

var id = 'page.' + conversation.wildcard
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

document.cacheDuration = 60000
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

document.cacheTags.add(id)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

document.cacheOnlyGet = true
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

if (conversation.request.method.name == 'POST') {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	var form = Prudence.Resources.getForm(conversation, {content: 'text'})
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	application.globals.put(id, form.content)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	document.cache.invalidate(id)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

var page = application.globals.get(id) || 'This page is empty.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

%>
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What we've done:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "document.cacheDuration"
target "http://threecrickets.com/api/javascript/?namespace=document&item=document.cacheDuration"

\end_inset

 is 0 milliseconds by default.
 We set it to 60 seconds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "document.cacheTags"
target "http://threecrickets.com/api/javascript/?namespace=document&item=document.cacheTags"

\end_inset

 allows us to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tag
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the cache entry.
 These tags can then be used to invalidate whole swaths of the cache at
 once.
 In this case, we only have one cache entry (the current page) that uses
 each particular tag.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "document.cacheOnlyGet"
target "http://threecrickets.com/api/javascript/?namespace=document&item=document.cacheOnlyGet"

\end_inset

 is set to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

true
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 because we don't want our 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

POST
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 requests to use the cache (otherwise they would only be processed for cache
 misses).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "document.cache.invalidate"
target "http://threecrickets.com/api/javascript/?namespace=document&item=document.cache"

\end_inset

 is used to invalidate a cache tag.
 In this case, it's our own.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's easy to see the caching in action via your browser's developer tools.
 In Firefox, turn on the 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "network monitor"
target "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Network_Monitor"

\end_inset

 by pressing CTRL+SHIFT+Q.
 In Chromium/Chrome, use CTRL+SHIFT+I and 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "select the “network” tab"
target "https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Refresh the page and you will see the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

GET
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 request you just sent.
 Click on it to see its details, and you will see the response headers returned
 from the server.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

X-Cache
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 family of headers will tell you the status of the server-side cache, such
 as whether it's a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hit
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

miss.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 You can disable these debug headers by configuring 
\bar under

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

debug
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 mode to false (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "settings-code"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, Prudence also utilizes the 
\emph on
client
\emph default
-side cache: if you continue refreshing the page from the same browser within
 the 60-second cache window, the web browser's conditional HTTP requests
 will return a 304 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

not modified
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 status, which tells the browser that there's no new information on the
 server, and thus it will efficiently avoid downloading the complete response,
 using its locally cached value instead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You've just vastly improved the scalability of your wiki, allowed for a
 faster user experience, all without ever compromising on the freshness
 of user data.
 Prudence caching is pure win.
\end_layout

For a real wiki you would probably want to store the wiki content in a database.
 Check out the 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href

 And of course there's

Our wiki is currently limited to web

 This would allow all kinds of clients to access our wiki, such as dedicated

 web applications (using

What we did:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

handle-
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 functions are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

entry points
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 into our program, with one per HTTP verb.
 From Prudence's perspective they are all encapsulated as a single resource
 class, with each resource instance having its own 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

conversation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 instance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
handleInit is a bit different in that it dynamically sets up our resource.
 The MIME type we've added will be used for content negotiation with the
 client: if several are available, Prudence will automatically select the
 best type according to the client's preferences.
 Note that order matters here: the first MIME types you add are preferred
 over the later ones.
 For our example, we'll only support JSON responses, though it's possible

\begin_layout Itemize
Note that we're making sure to invalidate the cache when we change the data:
 this is to make sure that the wiki pages will be updated accordingly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We'll also need to change our routing.js to capture the wildcard, again similar
 to what we did with the scriptlet page:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

app.routes = {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	'/page/*': '/page/',
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	'/api/*': '/api/'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Restart Prudence for the routing.js change to take effect, and then test
 it again:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

curl http://localhost:8080/wiki/api/test/
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, let's test an HTTP 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

PUT
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with new page content:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

curl --request PUT --data '{"content": "New page content!"}' http://localhost:80
80/wiki/api/test/
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And we can also 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

DELETE
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

curl --request DELETE http://localhost:8080/wiki/api/test/
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

curl http://localhost:8080/wiki/api/test/
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While testing with cURL, you can simultaneously test the wiki pages using
 the browser, as we did earlier.
 Both the API and the pages see the exact same data, as it's stored in the
 application.globals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Caching
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's add support for caching our API results.
 Again, it's very similar to what we did with our scriptlet, except that
 caching should be set up in handleInit:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

function handleInit(conversation) {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	conversation.addMediaTypeByName('application/json')
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	var id = 'page.' + conversation.wildcard
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	document.cacheDuration = 60000
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	document.cacheTags.add(id) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also note that the cache tag is exactly the same as we're using for scriptlet
 pages: this guarantees that the scriptlet pages will be updated even though
 the wiki is changed from here, and vice versa, even though what is being
 cached is quite different.
 Because the cache key depends on the URI, and the URIs for the pages and
 APIs are different, there will be no conflict.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To see the caching headers when using cURL, add the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

verbose
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 flag:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

curl --verbose http://localhost:8080/wiki/api/test/
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

curl --verbose --request PUT --data '{"content": "New page content!"}' http://lo
calhost:8080/wiki/api/test/
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Compression
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Prudence will automatically compress responses (using gzip or DEFLATE) if
 their size in bytes exceeds a certain threshold.
 Our wiki pages were likely too small, which is why you likely haven't seen
 compression.
 Let's lower the threshold, just for testing purposes.
 (You'll usually want that threshold: there are little or no bandwidth savings
 to be gained by compressing tiny responses, so the extra CPU load required
 for compression will be wasted.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Open the application's setting.js and edit the 
\bar under

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

app.settings.compression
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 setting (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "settings-compression"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

app.settings = {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	compression: {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		sizeThreshold: 0,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		exclude: []
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Restart Prudence for the setting to take effect.
 With a threshold of zero bytes, 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 responses should now be compressed---assuming the client accepts compression,
 as indeed web browsers do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Actually, Prudence integrates compression with caching: both compressed
 and uncompressed versions of the response are cached, so that compression
 will not have to be redone.
 This can result in significant savings for CPU usage in high loads.
 (And if a client needs a different kind of compression than the one that
 was stored in the cache---say, gzip was stored, but the client needs DEFLATE---
then Prudence will use the uncompressed cache entry, compress it, and then
 cache.
 Smart!)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's see it in action.
 Using the web browser's network monitor, you'll notice that the response
 headers now include 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Content-Encoding
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which means that our responses are compressed.
 gzip or DEFLATE will be chosen according to the web browser's preferences.
 Other than that (and the different response byte size) it should look identical.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To test using cURL, we'll have to do two things: explicitly tell the server
 that we support compression by sending the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Accept-Encoding
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 header, and also be ready to uncompress the result in order to display
 it, using cURL's 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

compressed
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 flag:
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

The URI-space
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

URI-space
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 represents the published set of all URIs supported by your server.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Supported
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 here means that unsupported URIs should return a 404 (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

not found
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) HTTP status code.
 In other words, they are not in the URI-space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Importantly, the URI-space can be potentially 
\emph on
infinite
\emph default
, in that you may support URI templates that match any number of actual
 URIs (within the limitations of maximum URI length).
 For example, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/service/{id}/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 could match 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/service/1/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/service/23664/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, etc., and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/film/*
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 can match 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/film/documentary/mongolia/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/film/cinema/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, etc.
 All URIs that match these templates belong to your URI-space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that this definition also encompasses the HTTP 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

PUT
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 verb, which can be used to create resources (as well as override them).
 If your server allows for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

PUT
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 at a specific set of URIs, then they are likewise part of your URI-space.
 In other words, you 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

support
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The URI-space is mostly configured in the application's routing.js file.
 However, your resource implementations can add their own special limits.
 For example, for the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/service/{id}/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 URI template we can make sure in code that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

{id}
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 would always be a decimal integer (returning 404 otherwise), thus effectively
 limiting the extent of the URI-space.
 More generally, Prudence supports 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

wildcard
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 URI templates, allowing you to delegate the parsing of the URI remainder
 entirely to your resource code.
 This chapter will cover it all.
\end_layout

 (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset href

), which look like URIs, but support the following two features:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Variables
\series default
 are strings wrapped in curly brackets.
 For example, here is a URI template with two variables: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/profile/{user}/{service}/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The variables will match any text until the next 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 You can access the string values of these variables in your resource as
 
\bar under

wildcard
\series default
 can be used as the last character in the URI template.
 For example,

\emph on

\emph default
.
 These are usually defined as JavaScript dicts, where the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

type
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 key is the name of the route type configuration, and the rest of the keys
 configure the type.
 During the application's bootstrap process, these dicts are turned in instances
 of classes in the Prudence.Routing API namespace (the class names have the
 first character of the type capitalized).
 The values set in the route type configuration dict are sent to the class
 constructor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a shortcut, you can just use a string value (the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 the default configuration.
 There are also special alternate forms for some of the commonly used types,

 is internally used by Prudence to handle the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dispatch
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 route type, via a server-side redirect.
 This introduces two special limitations on its use.
 First, it means that you

manual
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Second, you must make sure the

 always appears 
\emph on
before
\emph default
 any use of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

dispatch
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in app.routes.
 For example, if you attach the manual to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_inset

 in a chain (as in the default application template), and you also want
 to add a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 to that chain, you need to put the

\emph on
before
\emph default
 the

 Otherwise, you might cause an endless server-side redirect, leading to

\begin_inset Quotes erd

Prudence offers

\end_inset

/resources/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 subdirectory is directly mapped to URIs (but not URI templates).
 Both directory- and file-names are mapped in order of depth.
 By default, Prudence hides filename extensions from the published URIs,
 but uses these extensions to extracts MIME-type information for the resources.
 Also, mapping adds trailing slashes by default, by redirecting URIs without
 trailing slash to include them (on the client's side).
 Filesystem mapping provides the most 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

transparent
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 management of your URI-space, because you do not need to edit any configuration
 file: to change URIs, you simply move or rename files and directories.

: Capturing lets you map URI templates to fixed URIs, as well as perform
 other kinds of internal URI rewrites that are invisible to clients, allowing
 you to provide a published URI-space, which is different from your internal

 Note that another common use for capturing is to add support for URI templates
 in resource mapping, as is explained in 
\bar under
resource mapping (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
When embarking on a new project, you may want to give some thought as which
 paradigm to use.
 Generally, URI/resource separation is preferred for larger applications
 because it allows you more choices for your code organization.
 However, it does add an extra layer of configuration, and the URI-space
 is not as transparent as it is for resource mapping.
 It may make sense to use both paradigms in the same application where appropria
te.
 Read on, and make sure you understand how to use all three routing techniques.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Resource Mapping
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "resource-mapping"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Resource mapping is the most straightforward and most familiar technique
 and paradigm to create your URI-space.
 It relies on a one-to-one mapping between the filesystem (by default files
 under your application's 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/resources/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 subdirectory) to the URI-space.
 This is how static web servers, as well as the PHP, JSP and ASP platforms
 usually work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Prudence differs from the familiar paradigm in three ways:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
For manual and scriptlet resources, Prudence hides filename extensions from
 the URIs by default.
 Thus, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/resources/myresource.m.js
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 would be mapped to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/resources/myresource/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The reasons are two: 1) clients should not have to know about your internal
 implementation of the resource, and 2) it allows for cleaner and more coherent
 URIs.
 Note the filename extensions are used internally by Prudence (differently
 for manual and scriptlet resources).
 Note that this does not apply to static resources: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/resources/images/logo.png
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 will be mapped to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/images/logo.png
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
For manual and scriptlet resources, Prudence by default 
\emph on
requires 
\emph default
trailing slashes for URIs.
 If clients do not include the trailing slash, they will receive a 404 (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

not found
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) error.
 Again, the reasons are two: 1) it makes relative URIs always unambiguous,
 which is especially relevant in HTML and CSS, and 2) it clarifies the extent
 of URI template variables.
 As a courtesy to sloppy clients, you can manually add a permanent redirection
 to a trailing slash, using the 
\bar under

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

addSlash
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 route type (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "addslash-route-type"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
.
 For example:
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

app.routes = {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	'/main', 'addSlash',
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	'/person/profile/{id}': 'addSlash'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
This mapped URI-space can be manipulated using URI hiding and capturing,
 allowing you to support URI templates and rewrite URIs.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Mapping URI Templates
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem with resource mapping is that the URIs are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

static
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: they are only and exactly the the directory and file path.
 However, this limitation is easily overcome by Prudence's 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

capturing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 mechanism, which works on URI templates.
 For example, let's say you have a scriptlet resource file at 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/resources/user/profile.s.html
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but instead of it being mapped to the URI 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/user/profile/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, you want to access it via a URI template: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/user/profile/{userId}/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

app.routes = {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	'/user/profile/{userId}/': '/user/profile/'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A URI such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/user/profile/4431/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 would then be internally redirected to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/user/profile/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 URI.
 Within your 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

profile.s.html
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 file, you could then access the captured value as 
\bar under
conversation.locals (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "conversation-locals"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

<html>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

<body>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

<p>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

</body>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

</html>
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We've used a scriptlet resource in this example, but capturing can be used
 for both scriptlet and manual resources.
 The same 
\bar under
conversation.locals API (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

)
\bar default
 is used in both cases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may also want to make sure that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/user/profile/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 cannot be accessed 
\emph on
without
\emph default
 the user ID.
 To capture and hide together you can use the following shortcut notation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

app.routes = {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	'/user/profile/{userId}/': '/user/profile/!'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That final 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 implies hiding.
 You of course can also configure capturing and hiding separately, using
 the 
\bar under

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hidden
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 route type (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "hidden-route-type"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
.
 The following is equivalent to the above:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

app.routes = {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	'/user/profile/{userId}/': '/user/profile/',
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	'/user/profile/': '!'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Dynamic Capturing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
URI capturing can actually do more than just capture to a 
\emph on
single
\emph default
 URI: the target URI for a capture is, in fact, 
\emph on
also
\emph default
 a URI template, and can include any of the conversation attributes discussed
 in the 
\bar under
string interpolation guide (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "string-interpolation"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
.
 For example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

app.routes = {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	'/user/{userId}/preferences/': '/database/preferences/{m}/?id={userId}'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The request method name would then be interpolated into the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

{m}
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, for example it could be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

GET
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

POST
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 It would thus capture to different target URIs depending on the request.
 So, you could have 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/database/preferences/GET.html
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/database/preferences/POST.html
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 files in your 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/resources/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 subdirectory to handle different request methods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Dynamic Capture-and-Hide
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that if you use the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 capture-and-hide trick with dynamic capturing, Prudence will hide 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 URI that matches the template.
 For example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

app.routes = {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	'/user/{userId}/preferences/': '/database/preferences/{m}/!'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/database/preferences/GET/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is hidden, but also 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/database/preferences/anything/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, etc.
 If you do not want this behavior, then you should explicitly hide specific
 URIs instead:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

app.routes = {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	'/user/{userId}/preferences/': '/database/preferences/{m}/',
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	'/database/preferences/GET/': '!',
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	'/database/preferences/POST/': '!'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Limitations of Resource Mapping
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While resource mapping is very straightforward---one file per resource (or
 per type of resource if you capture URI templates)---it may be problematic
 in three ways:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In large URI-spaces you may suffer from having too many files.
 Though you can use 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/libraries/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to share code between your resources, mapping still requires a file per
 resource type.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Mapped manual resources must have all their entry points (handleInit, handleGet,
 etc.) defined as global functions.
 This makes it awkward to use object oriented programming or other kinds
 of code reuse.
 If you define your resources as classes, you would have to hook your class
 instance via the global entry points.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The URI-space is your public-facing structure, but your internal implementation
 may benefit from an entirely different organization.
 For example, some resources my be backed by a relational database, others
 by a memory cache, and others by yet another subsystem.
 It may make sense for you to organize your code according to subsystems,
 rather than the public URI-space.
 For this reason, you would want the URI-space configuration to be separate
 from your code organization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These problems might not be relevant to your application.
 But if they are, you may prefer the URI/resource separation paradigm, which
 can be implemented via resource capturing or dispatching, documented below.

)
\bar default
 provides a similar structural function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Resource capturing lets you use any public URI for any library scriptlet
 resource.
 For example, let's assume that you have the following files in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/libraries/includes/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/database/profile.html

\begin_inset Quotes eld

/database/preferences.html
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/cache/session.html
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which you organized in subdirectories according to the technologies used.
 Your URI-space can be defined thus, using the

\begin_layout Standard
Resource dispatching is also supported for Python, Ruby, PHP, Lua, Groovy
 and Clojure, via alternate dispatchers.
 To use them, you must specify the dispatcher, which is simply the name
 of the language in lowercase, when you configure the dispatch.
 For example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

app.routes = {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	'/session/{sessionId}/': {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		type: 'dispatch',
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		id: 'session',
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		dispatcher: 'python'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset

You can also use the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

@
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 shortcut like so:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

app.routes = {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\begin_layout Standard
Object-oriented inheritance is one useful way to reuse code while allowing
 for special implementations.
 Additionally, Prudence allows for a straightforward 
\bar under
Inversion of Control mechanism (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "ioc"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For both capturing and dispatching, you can inject set values to 
\bar under
conversation.locals (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "conversation-locals"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
.
 You would need to use the long-form notation to do this.
 Here are examples for both a capture and a dispatch:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

app.routes = {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	'/user/{userId}/': {type: 'capture', uri: '/user/', locals: {style: 'simple'}},
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	'/user/{userId}/full/': {type: 'capture', uri: '/user/', locals: {style:
 'full'}},
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	'/user/{userId}/preferences/': {type: 'dispatch', id: 'user', locals: {section:
 'preferences'}},
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	'/user/{userId}/profile/: {type: 'dispatch', id: 'user', locals: {section:
 'profile'}}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that in each case two URI templates are captured/matched to the exact
 same resource, but the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

locals
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 dict used is different for each.
 In your resource implementations, you can then allow for different behavior
 according to the value of the set 
\bar under
conversation.local (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "conversation-locals"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
.
 For example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

this.handleGet = function(conversation) {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	var section = conversation.locals.get('section')
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	if (section == 'preferences') {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	else if (section == profile') {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\begin_layout Standard
If your error resource is mapped under

Warning:
\series default
 If you decide to implement your error pages using a 
\emph on
non
\emph default
-static resource, you run the risk of the resource code throwing an exception.
 If that happens, it would cause a 500 status code.
 If the original error was 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 500, then this would confuse the client and complicate debugging.
 However, if the original status code 
\emph on
was
\emph default
 500, then it could be much worse: the error would trigger your error page
 to be displayed again, which might throw the exception again\SpecialChar \ldots{}
 resulting
 in a stack overflow error.
 For these reasons, it's probably a good idea to implement your error pages
 as static resources, at least for production deployments.

 dispatcher.
 You may change the default like so:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

app.routes = {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the above, our

\end_inset

 dispatcher.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Setting the Dispatch Map
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We've also seen that by default the dispatcher will attempt to execute your
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/dispatched/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 library in order to initialize the dispatch map.
 However, you may change this location per dispatcher like so:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

app.dispatchers = {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	javascript: '/mylib/mydispatchmap/'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is especially useful if you're using more than one dispatcher in your
 routing, because each dispatcher would need its own resource map.
 For example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

app.routes = {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 into Prudence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Under the hood, resource dispatching is handled by the URI capturing mechanism:
 the URI is captured to a special manual resource---the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dispatcher
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

---with an 
\bar under
injected value (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

)
\bar default
 specifying the ID of resource to which it should dispatch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Prudence's default dispatchers can be found in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/libraries/scripturian/prudence/dispatchers/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 directory of your container.
 For example, the JavaScript dispatcher is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/libraries/scripturian/prudence/dispatchers/javascript.js
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 You are encouraged to look at the code there in order to understand how
 dispatching works: it's quite straightforward delegation of the 
\bar under
entry points of a manual resource (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "manual-resources"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, you can also write your own dispatchers to handle different dispatching
 paradigms.
 To configure them, you will need to use a long-form for app.dispatchers.
 For example, here we override the default 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

javascript
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 dispatcher:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false

\begin_layout Plain Layout

app.dispatchers = {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	...

		customValue2: 'world'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dispatcher code (a standard manual resource) would be in a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/libraries/dispatchers/special-dispatcher.js
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 You would be able to access the dispatch ID there as the injected

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a resource gets hit by a request for the first time, there will likely
 be an initial delay.
 Your code may have to be compiled, or, if it has been cached, would at
 least have to be loaded and initialized.
 But all that should happen very fast: the more serious delay would be caused
 by initializing subsystems and libraries, such as connecting to databases,
 logging in to external services, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another source for delay is that, if you are 
\bar under
caching pages (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "server-side-caching"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
, as you very well should, then the some cached pages may not exist or be
 old.
 The first hit would thus need to generate and cache the page, which is
 much slower than using the cached version.
 For very large applications optimized for caching, a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cold
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 cache can cause serious problems: see the discussion in 
\bar under

)
\bar default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To avoid the delay, it's recommended that you ready your resources by hitting
 them as soon as Prudence starts up.
 This happens in two phases:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Defrosting
\series default
: Prudence will by default parse and compile the code for manual and scriptlet
 resources under your application's 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\end_inset

 subdirectory.
 See 
\bar under
configuring applications (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

)
\bar default
 if you wish to turn this feature off.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Preheating
\series default
: This causes an 
\bar under

)
\bar default
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

GET
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 on URIs, which would involve not only compiling the code, but also running
 it.
 The response payloads, as well as any errors, are ignored.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Your app.preheat is simply an array of relative URIs.
 As an example, let's preheat the homepage and a few specific resources:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

app.preheat = [
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	'/',
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	'/user/x/',
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	'/admin/'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

]
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that you can't use URI templates in app.preheat, only explicit URIs.
 Thus, if you have routed a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/user/{name}/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 URI template, you would have to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fill in
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the template with a value.
 In our example, we chose 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/user/x/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also note that because preheats are 
\emph on
internal
\emph default
 requests you can use this mechanism to preheat hidden URIs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you wish to do more specialized preheating, you may use the 
\bar under
startup task (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\bar default
.
 However, smart use of app.preheat can very effective, and it's very easy
 to use.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings

\begin_layout Plain Layout

function handleInit(conversation) {
\end_layout

Prudence handles content negotiation automatically, choosing the best media
 type according to list of acceptable and preferred formats sent by the
 client and this list.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Dynamic Media Types
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You might wonder why we add these supported media types dynamically for
 each request via a call to handleInit, since they are usually always the
 same for a resource.
 The reason is that sometimes they may not be the same.
 In handleInit, you can check for various conditions of the conversation,
 or even external to the conversation, to decide which media types to support.
 For example, you might not want to support XHTML for old browsers, but
 you'd want it at the top of the list for new browsers.
 Or, you might not be able to support PDF in case an external conversion
 service is down.
 In which case, you won't want it on the list at all, and instead want content
 negotiation to choose a different format that the client supports, such
 as DVI.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, this gives you a lot flexibility, at no real expense: adding media types
 per request is very lightweight.

\begin_layout Itemize
Arrays of bytes: Used for returning binary representations.
 Note that some languages (JavaScript, for example) have their own implementatio

 In such cases, you have to make sure to return JVM arrays.
 Internally, Prudence represents these values with a

 That is, a call to GET before the POST may succeed.
 Clients expect you to return a modified representation, in the selected

 Subsequent GET operations would then return the same modified representation.
 A failed POST should not alter the resource.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that the entity sent by the client does not have to be identical in

 In fact, it's likely that the client will send smaller delta updates in
 a POST, rather than a complete representation.

Note: It's good practice to always explicitly return null in handleDelete.
 Some languages return null if no explicit return statement is used.
 Others, however, return the value of the last executed operation, which
 could be a number, which would in turn become an HTTP status code for the
 client.
 This can lead to some very bizarre bugs, as clients receive apparently
 random status codes!

 Only if conditions are not met---for example if our resource is newer than

 Using handleGetInfo can thus improve on the gains of conditional requests:

You might be tempted to go ahead and provide a handleGetInfo entry point

 This is not necessarily a good practice, for three reasons:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
It could be that you don't need this optimization.
 Make sure, first, that you've actually identified a problem with performance
 or scalability, and that you've traced it to handleGet on this resource.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
It could be that you won't gain anything from this optimization.
 Caches and other optimizations along the route between your data and your
 client might already be doing a great job at keeping handleGet as efficient
 as it could be.
 If not, improving them could offer far greater benefits overall than a
 handleGetInfo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
It could be that you'll even hurt your scalability! The reason is that an
 efficient handleGetInfo implementation would need some mechanism in place
 to track of data modification, and this mechanism can introduce overhead
 into your system that causes it to scale worse than without your handleGetInfo.

Prudence works fine as a static web server: it's fast, supports non-blocking
 chunking, and has many useful features detailed below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, there are servers out there that specialize in serving static
 files and might do a better job, but you might be surprised by how far
 Prudence can take you.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that if Internet scalability is really important to you, it's better
 to even not use a standard web server at all, but instead rely on a CDN
 (Content Delivery Network) product or service with true global reach.

 That MIME type is determined by the filename extension.
 For example, a resource named

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 will have the

\begin_layout Standard
Prudence adds modification timestamp headers to all static resources, which
 allow clients, such as web browsers, to cache the contents and use conditional
 HTTP requests to later check if the cache needs to be refreshed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conditional HTTP is efficient and fast, but you can go one step further
 and tell clients to avoid even that check.
 Use the

With the above, Prudence will ask web browsers to cache common image types,
 CSS and JavaScript for 10 minutes before sending conditional HTTP requests.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Make sure you understand the implications of this: after the client's first
 hit, for 10 minutes 
\emph on
it will not be able to see changes to that static resource
\emph default
.
 The client's web browser would continue using the older version of the
 resource until its cache expires.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Bypassing the Client Cache
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "static-resources-bypassing-the-client-cache"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a widely-used trick that lets you use client-side caching while
 still letting you propagate changes 
\emph on
immediately
\emph default
.
 It makes use of the fact that the client cache uses the 
\emph on
complete 
\emph default
URL as the cache key, which 
\emph on
includes the query matrix
\emph default
.
 If you use a query param with the URL, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

static
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 resource will ignore it, but the client will still consider it a new resource
 in terms of caching.
 For example, let's say you include an image in an HTML page:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

<img src="/media/logo.png" />
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you made a change to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

logo.png
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 file, and you want to bypass the client cache, then just change the HTML
 to this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

<img src="/media/logo.png?_=1" />
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Voila: it's a new URL, so older cached values will not be used.
 For Prudence, the query makes no difference.
 You can then simply increase the value of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

_
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 query param every time you make a change.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This trick works so well that, if you use it, it's recommended that you
 actually ask clients to cache these resources 
\emph on
forever
\emph default
.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Forever
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is not actually supported, but it's customary to use 10 years in the future
 as a practical equivalent.
 Use 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

farFuture
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as a shortcut in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cacheControl
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Remembering to increase the query param in all uses of the resource might
 be too cumbersome and error-prone.
 Consider using the 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Diligence Assets service"
target "http://threecrickets.com/diligence/manual/service/assets/"

\end_inset

, or something similar, instead: it calculates digests for the resource
 file contents and use them as the query param.
 Thus, any change to the file contents will result in a new, unique URL.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
What happens to cache entries that have been marked to expire in 10 years,
 but are no longer used by your site? They indeed will linger in your client's
 web browser cache.
 This isn't too bad: web browsers normally are configured with a maximum
 cache size and the disk space will be cleared and reused if needed.
 It's still an inelegant waste, for which unfortunately there is no solution
 in HTTP and HTML.

\begin_layout Standard
When writing JavaScript code, you likely want to use a lot of spacing, indentati

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This chapter deals with sending and receiving data to and from the client
 (as well as external servers) via REST, focusing especially on the particulars
 for HTTP and HTML.
 It does 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 deal with storing data in backend databases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Prudence is a minimalist RESTful platform, 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 a data-driven web framework, though such frameworks are built on top of
 it.
 Check out our 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Diligence"

\end_inset

, which is a full-blown framework based on Prudence and 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "MongoDB"
target "http://www.mongodb.org/"

\end_inset

.
 You may also be interested in the 
\bar under
Model-View-Controller (MVC) chapter (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "mvc"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
, which guides you through an approach to integrating data backends.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
URLs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simplest way in which a client sends data to the server is via the URL.
 The main part of the URL is parsed by Prudence and used for 
\bar under
routing (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "app-routes"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
, but some of it is left for your own uses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Generally, the whole or parts of the request URL can be accessed via the
 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "conversation.reference API"
target "http://threecrickets.com/api/javascript/?namespace=conversation&item=conversation.reference"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the matrix of parameters after the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the URI.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, consider this URL:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

http://mysite.org/myapp/user?name=Albert%20Einstein&enabled=true
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

%20
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 URI encoding for the space character.
 Query params will be automatically decoded by Prudence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In JavaScript, you can use 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Prudence.Resources.getQuery API"
target "http://threecrickets.com/api/javascript/?namespace=Prudence.Resources&item=Prudence.Resources.getQuery"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

var query = Prudence.Resources.getQuery(conversation, {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	name: 'text',
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	enabled: 'bool'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

})
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the case of multiple params with the same name, the API would return
 the first param that matches the name.
 Otherwise, you can also retrieve all values into an array:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

var query = Prudence.Resources.getQuery(conversation, {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	name: 'text[]',
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	enabled: 'bool'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

})
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Low Level
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For non-JavaScript you can use the lower-level 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	enabled: conversation.query.get('enabled') == 'true'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Use 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "conversation.queryAll"
target "http://threecrickets.com/api/javascript/?namespace=conversation&item=conversation.queryAll"

\end_inset

 if you need to find multiple params with the same name.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The Wildcard
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "the-wildcard"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you've configured a URI template with a 
\bar under
wildcard (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "uri-templates"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
 in routing.js, you can access the

\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "conversation.wildcard"
target "http://threecrickets.com/api/javascript/?namespace=conversation&item=conversation.wildcard"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that you can also 
\bar under
interpolate the wildcard into the target URI (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "interpolating-the-wildcard"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Fragments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is whatever appears after the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

#
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the URI.
 Note that for the web 
\emph on
fragments are only used for response URLs
\emph default
: those sent from the server to the client.
 This is enforced: web browsers will normally 
\emph on
strip fragments
\emph default
 before sending URLs to the server, but the server can send them to web
 browsers.
 They are commonly used in HTML anchors:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

<a name="top" /><h1>This is the top!</h1>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

<p>Click <a href="#top">here</a> to go to the top</p>
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But you can also use them in 
\bar under
redirects (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref

\end_inset

)
\bar default
:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false

\begin_layout Plain Layout

conversation.redirectSeeOther(conversation.base + '#top')
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Request Payloads
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In JavaScript, you can use 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Prudence.Resources.getEntity API"
target "http://threecrickets.com/api/javascript/?namespace=Prudence.Resources&item=Prudence.Resources.getEntity"

 to extract the data in various formats:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false

\begin_layout Plain Layout

document.require('/prudence/resources/')
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

var data = Prudence.Resources.getEntity(conversation, 'json')
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Otherwise, you can use the lower-level 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "conversation.entity API"
target "http://threecrickets.com/api/javascript/?namespace=conversation&item=conversation.entity"

\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

var text = conversation.entity.text
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

var data = Sincerity.JSON.from(text)
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that if the payload comes from a HTML 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 form, 
\bar under
better APIs are available (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref

\end_inset

)
\bar default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
MIME Types
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "request-payloads-mime-types"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you wish to support multiple request payload MIME types, be sure to check
 before retrieving:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

var type = conversation.entity.mediaType.name
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

if (type == 'application/json') {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	var data = Prudence.Resources.getEntity(conversation, 'json')
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

} else if (type == 'image/png') {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	var data = Prudence.Resources.getEntity(conversation, 'binary')
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Consumption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that 
\emph on
you can only retrieve the request payload once
\emph default
.
 Once the data stream is consumed, its data resources are released.
 Thus, the following would result in an error:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

print(conversation.entity.text)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

print(conversation.entity.text)
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simple solution is retrieve once and store in a variable:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

var text = conversation.entity.text
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

print(text)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

print(text)
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Parsing Formats
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Which formats can Prudence parse, and how well?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This depends on which programming language you're using: for example, both
 Python and Ruby both come with basic JSON support in their standard libraries,
 and Python supports XML, as well.
 Sincerity provides JavaScript with support for both.
 Of course, you can install libraries that handle these and other formats,
 and even use JVM libraries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For other formats, you may indeed need to add other libraries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
A decent starting point is Restlet's 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "ecosystem of extensions"
target "http://restlet.org/learn/javadocs/2.2/jse/ext/index.html?overview-summary.html"

\end_inset

, which can handle several data formats and conversions.
 However, these are likely more useful in pure Java Restlet programming,
 where they can plug into Restlet's sophisticated annotation-based conversion
 system.
 In Prudence, you will usually be applying any generic parsing library to
 the raw textual or binary data.
 Still, the Restlet extensions are useful for 
\bar under
response payloads (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "restlet-data-extensions"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Cookies
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "cookies"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cookies represent a small client-side database, which the server can use
 to retrieve or store per-client data.
 Not all clients support cookies, and even those that do (most web browsers)
 might have the feature disabled, so it's not always good idea to rely on
 cookies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
From the Client
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Retrieve a specific cookie from those the client send you according to its
 name using 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "conversation.getCookie"
target "http://threecrickets.com/api/javascript/?namespace=conversation&item=conversation.getCookie"

\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

var session = conversation.getCookie('session')
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

if (null !== session) {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	print(session.value)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Or use 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "conversation.cookies"
target "http://threecrickets.com/api/javascript/?namespace=conversation&item=conversation.cookies"

\end_inset

 to iterate through all available cookies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following attributes are available:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
name: (read only)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
version: (integer) per a specific cookie
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
value: textual, or text-encoded binary data (note that most clients have
 strict limits on how much total data is allowed to be stored in all cookies
 per domain)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
domain: the client should only use the cookie with this domain and its subdomain
s (web browsers will not let you set a cookie for a domain which is not
 the domain of the request or a subdomain of it)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
path: the client should only use the cookie with URIs that begin with this
 path (“/”, the default, would mean to use it with all URIs)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
To the Client
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can ask that a client modify any of the cookies you've retrieved 
\emph on
from
\emph default
 it, upon a successful response, by calling the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

save
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings

Note that createCookie will retrieve the cookie if it already exists.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When sending cookies 
\emph on
to
\emph default
 the client, you can set the following attributes 
\emph on
in addition
\emph default
 to those mentioned above, but note that you 
\emph on
cannot
\emph default
 retrieve them later:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
maxAge: age in seconds, after which the client should delete the cookie;
 maxAge=0 deletes the cookie immediately, while maxAge=-1 (the default)
 asks the client to keep the cookie only for the duration of the “session”
 (this is defined by the client; for most web browsers this means that the
 cookie will be deleted when the browser is closed)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
secure: true if the cookie is meant to be used only in secure connections
 (defaults to false)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
accessRestricted: true if the cookie is meant to be used only in authenticated
 connections (defaults to false)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
comment: some clients store this, some discard it
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can ask the client to delete a cookie by calling its 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

delete
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Note that this is identical to setting maxAge=0 and calling

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Security Concerns
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You should never store any unencrypted secret data in cookies: though web
 browsers attempt to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sandbox
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 cookies, making sure that only the server (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

domain
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) that stored them can retrieve them, they can be hijacked by other means.
 Better yet, don't store 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 secrets in cookies, even if encrypted, because even encryptions can be
 hacked.
 A cautious exception can be made for 
\emph on
short-term
\emph default
 secrets: for example, if you store a session ID in a cookie, make sure
 to expire it on the server so that it cannot be used later by a hacker.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A separate security concern for users is that cookies can be used to surreptitio
usly track user activity.
 This works because any resource on a web page---even an image hosted by
 an advertising company---can use cookies, and can also track your client's
 IP address.
 Uses various heuristics it is possible to identify individual users and
 track parts of their browser history.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because of these security concerns, it is recommended that you devise a
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cookie policy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for users and make it public, assuming you require the use of cookies for
 your site.
 In particular, let users know which 3rd-party resources you are including
 in your web pages that may be storing cookies, and for what purpose.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cookies are a security concern for you, too: you cannot expect all your
 clients to be standard, friendly web browsers.
 Clients might not be honoring your requests for cookie modifications, and
 might be sending you cookies that you did not ask them to store.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Be careful with cookies! They are a hacker's playground.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Client-side redirection in HTTP is handled via response headers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
By Routing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you need to constantly redirect a specific resource or a URI pattern,
 you should configure it in your routing.js, using the 
\bar under

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

redirect
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 route type (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

Note that in this example we 
\bar under
interpolated the wildcard (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "interpolating-the-wildcard"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
By API
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can also redirect programmatically by using the 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "conversation.redirectPermament"
target "http://threecrickets.com/api/javascript/?namespace=conversation&item=conversation.redirectPermament"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href

\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "conversation.redirectTemporary"
target "http://threecrickets.com/api/javascript/?namespace=conversation&item=conversation.redirectTemporary"

\end_inset

 APIs:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

conversation.redirectSeeOther(conversation.base + '/help/')
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that if you redirect via API, the client will ignore the response payload
 if there is one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
In HTML
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We're mentioning this here only for completion: via HTML, redirection is
 handled entirely in the web browser, with no data going to/from the server.
 A scriptlet resource example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Go <a href="<%= conversation.base + '/elsewhere/' %>">elsewhere</a>.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Server-Side Redirection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Prudence, this is called 
\bar under

capturing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref

 and has particular use cases.
 (It can indeed be confusing that this functionality is often grouped together
 with client-side redirection.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
HTML Forms

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
HTML's 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

form
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 tag works in two very different modes, depending on the value of its 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

method
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 param:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

get
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: The form fields are all turned into query params and appended to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

action
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 URL.
 It is important to remember that an HTTP 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

GET
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is 
\emph on
idempotent
\emph default
 and should not be used to store new data, but rather as a way to represent
 existing data in a particular way.
 Actually, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

get
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 forms are not that useful, and are mostly an odd legacy from the early
 days of the World Wide Web, where 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

GET
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 was the only the supported HTTP verb on some platforms.
 See

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: The form fields are actually encoded in the same way that query params
 are, but instead of being affixed to the URL, they are sent as the payload
 with an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

application/x-www-form-urlencoded
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 MIME type.
 Though you can of course access this payload 
\bar under
directly (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref

\bar default
, it is recommended to use the specialized APIs detailed here.

\begin_layout Plain Layout

})
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the case of multiple fields with the same name, the API would return
 the first fields that matches the name.
 Otherwise, you can also retrieve all values into an array:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Accepting Uploads
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
HTML supports file uploads using forms and the

\end_inset

 input type.
 However, the default 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

application/x-www-form-urlencoded
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 MIME type for forms will not be able to encode files, so you must change
 it to

 For example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard

\bar under
Scriptlet resources (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\bar default
 might seem to always return textual payloads.
 Actually, by default they will negotiate a compression format, which if
 selected will result in a binary: the compressed version of the text.
 But all of that is handled automatically by Prudence for that highly-optimized
 use case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For 
\bar under
manual resources (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "manual-resources"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
, you can return any arbitrary payload by simply returning a value in handleGet,
 handlePost or handlePut.
 Both strings and JVM byte arrays are supported.
 A textual example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

function handleGet(conversation) {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	return 'My payload'

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

function handleGet(conversation) {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	var payload = Sincerity.JVM.newArray(10, 'byte')

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	return payload
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that if you return a 
\emph on
number
\emph default
, it will be treated specially as an HTTP status code.
 If you wish to return the number as the content of an textual payload,
 simply convert it to a string:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings

\begin_layout Plain Layout

function handleGet(conversation) {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	return String(404)

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you wish to set both the payload 
\emph on
and
\emph default
 the status code, use an API for either one.
 Here well use the

Overriding the Negotiated Format

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The response payload's MIME type and language have likely been selected
 for you automatically by Prudence, via HTTP content negotiation, based
 on the list of preferences you set up in handleInit.
 However, it's possible to override these value via the 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "conversation.mediaType"
target "http://threecrickets.com/api/javascript/?namespace=conversation&item=conversation.mediaType"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "conversation.language"
target "http://threecrickets.com/api/javascript/?namespace=conversation&item=conversation.language"

\end_inset

 API families.
 This should be done sparingly: content negotiation is the preferred RESTful
 mechanism for determining the response format, and the negotiated values
 should be honored.
 However, it could be useful and even necessary to override it if you 
\emph on
cannot 
\emph default
use content negotiation, which might be the case if your clients don't support
 it, and yet you still want to support multiple formats.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Your textual and binary representations might be serialized versions of

 But if the request is 
\bar under
internal (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

ization.
 A simple optimization would be to pass the data 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

as is,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 actually very similarly to a return value for a standard function call.

External Requests

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Prudence uses the Restlet library to serve RESTful resources, but can also
 use it to consume them.
 In fact, the client API nicely mirrors the server API.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that Prudence can also handle 
\bar under
internal REST requests (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "internal-requests"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
 without going through HTTP or object serialization.
 There is an entire 
\bar under
internal URI-space (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "internal-uri-space"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
 at your fingertips.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
It's not a good idea to send an external request while handling a user request,
 because it could potentially cause a long delay and hold up the user thread.
 It would be better to use a 
\bar under
background task (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "background-tasks"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
.
 A possible exception is requests to servers that you control yourself,
 and that represent a subsystem of your application.
 In that case, you should still use 
\bar under
short timeouts (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "external-requests-timeout"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
 and fail gracefully.
\end_layout

Timeout
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "external-requests-timeout"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Surprisingly, you cannot set the timeout per request, but instead you need
 to configure the timeout globally for the 
\bar under
HTTP client (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "component-clients"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
.
 The reason for this is that the client works asynchronously, via a thread
 pool that is initialized upon startup.
 Because you don't know which thread will handle your request, you can't
 set a specific timeout for it.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Conditional Requests
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
HTTP clients, such as web browsers, store downloaded content in their local
 cache, marking it with a modification date and tag according to HTTP headers
 in the response.
 Subsequent requests to the same URL will be “conditional,” meaning that
 the client will tell the server what the latest modification date it has.
 If the server does not have new data, then it returns an empty response
 with the 304 “not modified” HTTP status, letting the client know that it
 is safe to use its cached version.
 This saves both bandwidth and processing resources on the server.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To support conditional requests, you have to explicitly set at least one
 of 
\bar under
conversation.modificationDate (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "../api/|conversation-modification-date"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
 and 
\bar under
conversation.tag (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "../api/|conversation-tag"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
.
 If you implement 
\bar under
handleGetInfo (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "handle-get-info"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
, you should be returning one of these values instead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that these attributes are ignored in case you are constructing and
 returning your own 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Representation instance"
target "http://www.restlet.org/documentation/2.0/jse/api/index.html?org/restlet/representation/Representation.html"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Client Caching
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Though clients rely on a local cache for conditional requests, you can provide
 them with additional caching directives.
 In Prudence, you can control the expiration of the client's cached entry
 with 
\bar under
conversation.maxAge (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "../api/|conversation-max-age"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
 or 
\bar under
conversation.expirationDate (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "../api/|conversation-expiration-date"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Explicitly setting cache directives has an important side effect: most clients
 will 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 send conditional HTTP requests for the cached data until the cache entry
 expires.
 This allows you to save bandwidth and improves client performance, but
 at the expense of not being able to update the client upon changes.
 Use with care.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Two Caching Strategies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The default Prudence application template is configured for very minimal
 caching, which is suitable for development deployments.
 However, once you are ready to move your application to production or staging,
 you will likely want a more robust caching strategy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will here present two common strategies, and discuss the pros and cons
 of each.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Cautious: Short-Term Caching
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a great strategy if you're 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 feeling very confident about managing caching in your application logic.
 Perhaps you have too many different kinds of pages requiring different
 caching strategies.
 Perhaps you can't maintain the strict discipline required for more aggressive
 caching, due to a quickly changing application structure (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

agile
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

?) or third-party constraints.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you're in that boat, short-term caching is recommended over no caching
 at all, because it would still offer better performance and scalability.
 Because caching is short-term, any mistakes you make won't last for very
 long, and can quickly be fixed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How short a term depends on two factors: 1) usage patterns for your web
 site, and 2) the content update frequency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a user tends to spend about an hour browsing your site, then a one-hour
 duration

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
minimumTimeBetweenValidityChecks
\series default
: Scripturian makes sure to reload (and thus re-compile) code if the source
 files are changed, for which it compares the file's modification dates
 to the cached values.
 For high-volume deployments, this might involve constantly checking the
 filesystem, potentially resulting in performance problems on some operating

 This value allows you to enforce a delay between these checks.
 It's a good idea to set it to anything greater than zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
defaultDocumentName
\series default
: When a document name specifies to a directory, Scripturian will internally
 change the specification to a document with this name in the subdirectory

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
defaultExtension
\series default
: If more than one file in a directory has the same name but different extension

\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These are not “local” in the same way that code scope locals are.
 The term “local” here should be read as “local to the conversation.” They
 are “global” in the sense that they can be accessed by any function in
 your code, but are “local” in the sense that they persist only for the
 duration of the user request.
 (Compare with “thread locals” in the JVM, which are also “local” in a specific
 sense.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may ask, then, why you wouldn't want to just use your language globals,
 which have similar scope and life.
 conversation.locals have three main uses in Prudence:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
To easily share conversation-scope state between scriptlets written in different
 languages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
To share state for deferred conversations---see 
\bar under
conversation.defer (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "../api/|conversation-defer"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
.
 In such cases, your language's globals would not persist across the thread
 boundaries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
They are Prudence's general mechanism for sending state to your code in
 a conversation.
 For example, 
\bar under
captured URI segments are stored here (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

Global Variables

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You know how local variables work in your programming language: they exist
 only for the duration of a function call, after which their state is discarded.
 If you want state to persist beyond the function call, you use a global
 variable (or a “static” local, which is really a global).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
But in Prudence, you cannot expect global variables to persist beyond a
 user request.

\emph default
 To put it another way, you should consider every single user request as
 a separate “program” with its own global state.

\begin_layout Standard
Why does Prudence discard your language's globals? This has to do with allowing
 for concurrency while shielding you from the complexity of having to guarantee
 the thread-safety of your code.
 By making each user request a separate “program,” you don't have to worry
 about overlapping shared state, coordinating thread access, etc., for every
 use of a variable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
The exception to this is code in /resources/, in which language globals
 
\emph on
might
\emph default
 persist.
 To improve performance, Prudence caches the global context for these in
 memory, with the side effect that your language globals persist beyond
 a single user request.
 For various reasons, however, Prudence may reset this global context.
 You should not rely on this side effect, and instead always use 
\bar under
application.globals (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "application-globals"

\end_inset

)
\bar default

\begin_layout Standard
The rule of thumb is to always prefer to use
\bar under
 application.globals (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "application-globals"

 By doing so, you'll minimize interdependencies between applications, and
 help make each application deployable on its own.

\end_inset

)
\bar default
---similar concerns apply to it) only when you explicitly need a bridge
 
\emph on
between 
\emph default
applications.
 Examples:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
To save resources.
 For example, if an application detects that a database connection has already
 been opened by another application in the Prudence instance, and stored
 in application.sharedGlobals, then it could use that connection rather than
 create a new one.
 This would only work, of course, if a few applications share the same database,
 which is common in many deployments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
To send messages between applications.
 This would be necessary if operations in one application could affect another.
 For example, you could place a task queue in application.sharedGlobals,
 where applications could queue required operations.
 A thread in another application would consume these and act accordingly.
 Of course, you will have to plan for asynchronous behavior, and especially
 allow for failure.
 What happens if the consumer application is down? It may make more sense
 in these cases to use a persistent storage, such as a database, for the
 queue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Generally, if you find yourself having to rely on application.sharedGlobals,
 ask yourself if your code would be better off encapsulated as a single
 application.
 Remember that Prudence has powerful URL routing, support for virtual hosting,
 etc., letting you easily have one application work in several sites simultaneous
ly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Note for Clojure flavor: 
\emph on
All
\emph default
 Clojure vars are VM-wide globals equivalent in scope to executable.globals.
 You usually work with namespaces that Prudence creates on the fly, so they
 do not persist beyond the execution.
 However, if you explicitly define a namespace, then you can use it as a
 place for shared state.
 It will then be up to you to make sure that your namespace doesn't collide
 with that of another application installed in the Prudence instance.
 Though this approach might seem to break our rule of thumb here, of preferring
 application.globals to application.sharedGlobals, it is more idiomatic to
 Clojure and Lisps generally.

\begin_layout Quote
Note for Clojure flavor: Though Clojure goes a long way towards simplifying
 concurrent programming, it does not solve the problem of concurrent access
 to global state.
 You still need to read this section!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, this code (Python flavor) is broken:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "breaklines=true"
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

def get_connection()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	data_source = application.globals['myapp.data.source']
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	if data_source is None:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		data_source = data_source_factory.create()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		application.globals['myapp.data.source'] = data_source
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	return data_source.get_connection()
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem is that in the short interval between comparing the value in
 the “if” statement and setting the global value in the “then” statement,
 another thread may have already set the value.
 Thus, the “data_source” instance you are referring to in the current thread
 would be different from the “myapp.data.source” global used by other threads.
 The value is not truly shared! In some cases, this would only result in
 a few extra, unnecessary resources being created.
 But in some cases, when you rely on the uniqueness of the global, this
 can lead to subtle bugs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
This may seem like a very rare occurrence to you: another thread would have
 to set the value 
\emph on
exactly
\emph default
 between our comparison and our set.
 If your application has many concurrent users, and your machine has many
 CPU cores, it can actually happen quite frequently.
 And, even if rare, your application has a chance of breaking if 
\emph on
just two users use it at the same time
\emph default
.
 This is not a problem you can gloss over, even for simple applications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Use this code instead:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "breaklines=true"
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

def get_connection()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	data_source = application.globals['myapp.data.source']
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	if data_source is None:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		data_source = data_source_factory.create()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		data_source = application.getGlobal('myapp.data.source', data_source)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	return data_source.get_connection()
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The getGlobal call is an atomic compare-and-set operation.
 It guarantees that the returned value is the unique one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Optimizing for Performance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may have noticed, in the code above, that if another thread had already
 set the global value, then our created data source would be discarded.
 If data source creation is heavy and slow, then this could affect our performan
ce.
 The only way to guarantee that this would not happen would be to make the
 entire operation atomic, by synchronizing it with a lock:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's an example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "breaklines=true"
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

def get_connection()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	lock = application.getGlobal('myapp.data.source.lock', RLock())
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	lock.acquire()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	try:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		data_source = application.globals['myapp.data.source']
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		if data_source is None:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

			data_source = data_source_factory.create()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

			application.globals['myapp.data.source'] = data_source
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		return data_source.get_connection()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	finally:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		lock.release()
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that we have to store our RLock as a unique global, too.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not only is the code above complicated, but synchronization has its own
 performance penalties, which 
\emph on
might
\emph default
 make this apparent optimization actually perform worse.
 It's definitely not a good idea to blindly apply this technique: attempt
 it only if you are experiencing a problem with resource use or performance,
 and then make sure that you're not making things worse with synchronization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's a final version of our get_connection function that lets you control
 whether to lock access.
 This can help you more easily compare which technique works better for
 your application:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "breaklines=true"
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

def get_connection(lock_access=False)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	if lock_access:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		lock = application.getGlobal('myapp.data.source.lock', RLock())
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		lock.acquire()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	try:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		data_source = application.globals['myapp.data.source']
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		if data_source is None:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

			data_source = data_source_factory.create()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

			if lock_access:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

				application.globals['myapp.data.source'] = data_source
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

			else:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

				data_source = application.getGlobal('myapp.data.source', data_source)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		return data_source.get_connection()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	finally:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		if lock_access:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

			lock.release()
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Complicated, isn't it? Unfortunately, complicated code and fine-tuning is
 the price you must pay in order to support concurrent access, which is
 the key to Prudence's scalability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But, don't be discouraged.
 The standard protocol for using Prudence's globals will likely be good
 enough for the vast majority of your state-sharing needs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
APIs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Prudence provides you with an especially rich set of APIs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The core APIs required for using Prudence are multilingual, in that they
 are implemented via standard JVM classes that can be called from all supported
 programming languages: JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP, Lua, Groovy and Clojure.
 Indeed, the entire JVM standard APIs can be access in this manner, in addition
 to any JVM library installed in your container (under 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/libraries/jars/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most of these languages additionally have a rich standard API of their own
 which you can use, as well as an ecology of libraries.
 JavaScript, however, stands out for having a very meager standard API.
 To fill in this gap, Sincerity comes with a useful set of JavaScript Libraries,
 which you are free to use.
 Some of these are written pure JavaScript, offering new and useful functionalit
y, while others provide JavaScript-friendly wrappers over standard JVM libraries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, Prudence comes with JavaScript-friendly wrappers over the core
 Prudence APIs.
 Future versions of Prudence may provide similar friendly wrappers for the
 other supported languages (please contribute!).
 Until then, there's nothing that these wrappers can do that you can't do
 with the core APIs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Using the Documentation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
The Prudence team has spent a great amount of time on meticulously documenting
 the APIs.
 Please send us a 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "bug report"
target "http://code.google.com/p/prudence/issues/list"

\end_inset

 if you find a mistake, or think that the documentation can use some clarificati
on!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the sake of coherence all these APIs are 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "documented together online"
target "http://threecrickets.com/api/javascript/"

\end_inset

 in their JavaScript format.
 This includes both the multilingual as well as the JavaScript-specific
 APIs.
 For the multilingual APIs, just make sure to call the APIs using the appropriat
e syntax for the programming language you are using.
 For example, here is the same API call in all supported languages:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

JavaScript: conversation.redirectSeeOther('http://newsite.org/')
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Python:     conversation.redirectSeeOther('http://newsite.org/')
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Ruby:       $conversation.redirect_see_other 'http://newsite.org/'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

PHP:        $conversation->redirectSeeOther('http://newsite.org/');
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Lua:        conversation:redirectSeeOther('http://newsite.org/')
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Groovy:     conversation.redirectSeeOther('http://newsite.org/')
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Clojure:    (..
 conversation redirectSeeOther "http://newsite.org/")
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The APIs are not fully documented here, but rather summarized to give you
 a global view of what's available, with links to the full documentation
 available online.
 The documentation also lets you view the complete JavaScript source code.

A few more language-specific notes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
JavaScript
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Prudence's current JavaScript engine, Rhino, does not provide dictionary
 access to maps, so you must use get- and put- notation to access map attributes.
 For example, use 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

application.globals.get('myapp.data.name')
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 rather than 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

application.globals['myapp.data.name']
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Python
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you're using the Jepp engine, rather than the default Jython engine,
 you will need to use get- and set- notation to access attributes.
 For example, use 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

application.getArguments()
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to access application.arguments in Jepp.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Ruby
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Prudence's Ruby engine, JRuby, conveniently lets you use the Ruby naming
 style for API calls.
 For example, you can use $application.get_global instead of $application.getGloba
l.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Lua
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You will need to use the get- and set- notation to access attributes.
 For example, you must use 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

conversation:getEntity()
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to access conversation.entity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Clojure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You will need to use get- and set- notation to access attributes.
 For example, use 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

(.getArguments application)
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to access application.arguments.
 You can also use Clojure's bean form, for example 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

(bean application)
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, to create a read-only representation of Prudence services.

How is Prudence different from Node.js?
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "prudence-vs-node-js"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both are server-side platforms for creating network servers using JavaScript.
 Both have evolved to support package managers: Sincerity for Prudence,
 npm for Node.js.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But that's pretty much where the similarities end.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Purpose and Architecture
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Prudence is a platform for REST services, such as web pages and RESTful
 APIs.
 Node.js is a platform for asynchronous services, such as streaming video
 and audio servers.
 These are 
\emph on
very
\emph default
 different use cases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, note that 
\emph on
both
\emph default
 use non-blocking servers at the low level.
 So they're 
\emph on
both
\emph default
 asynchronous in 
\emph on
that
\emph default
 particular respect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Actually, because Prudence uses 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Jetty"
target "http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/"

\end_inset

 as its driver, you have the option to change it to a 
\emph on
blocking
\emph default
 server, which may behave better in some controlled workloads.
 See 
\bar under
configuring servers (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "servers"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
.
 Generally, Jetty is designed from the ground-up for web services, and behaves
 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "smartly"
target "http://webtide.intalio.com/2010/06/lies-damned-lies-and-benchmarks-2/"

\end_inset

 and exceptionally well under high volumes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On top of the server Prudence uses a multi-threaded RESTful application
 environment with 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Restlet"
target "http://restlet.org/"

\end_inset

 handling the many intricacies of HTTP.
 Why multi-threaded? Because generating HTML is logically a 
\emph on
single-event
\emph default
 procedure: at the moment you get the client's request, you generate the
 HTML content and send it immediately.
 Thus, via a managed, configurable thread-pool, Prudence can leverage multi-core
 CPUs as well as highly-concurrent database backends to serve several several
 user requests simultaneously.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Node.js could not be more different: it is by design 
\emph on
single
\emph default
-threaded and event-
\emph on
driven
\emph default
: requests are 
\emph on
never 
\emph default
handed simultaneously, and only a single CPU core would ever be used by
 the HTTP server itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Seems odd? Actually, this 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

raw
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 architecture makes a lot of sense for streaming applications: as opposed
 to HTML pages, streams are always 
\emph on
multi
\emph default
-event procedures, each event generating a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

chunk
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the stream that saturates the socket with data.
 There is no advantage to using more than one thread if a single thread
 is already taking up all the bandwidth.
 In fact, thread synchronization could introduce overhead that would slow
 the server down.
 Really, your only variable in terms of scalability is the size of the chunks:
 you'll want them smaller under high load in order to degrade performance
 fairly among clients.
 That said, other libraries you might use from Node.js 
\emph on
can and do
\emph default
 use threads: this is useful for CPU-bound workloads like CPU-intensive
 video encoding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Node.js is great for its intended use case.
 It's vastly easier to write event handlers in JavaScript than in C/C++,
 and JavaScript also makes it easy to bootstrap the server.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
You're Doing It Wrong
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's very odd that Node.js has become a popular platform for the 
\emph on
non
\emph default
-streaming, data-driven web: 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "the Express framework"
target "http://expressjs.com/"

\end_inset

, for example, provides some minimal RESTful functionality on top of Node.js.
 But event-driven servers are not designed for REST, and are in fact quite
 a bad fit: consider that in a single-threaded runtime, if a single event
 handler hangs, the whole server will hang.
 Node.js deals with the problem by in effect offloading it to external libraries
 written in C++: its database drivers, for example, handle queries in their
 own connection thread pools, and push events to Node.js when data is available.
 But in your JavaScript event handlers, you have to take extra care not
 to do any time-consuming work: a delay you cause would affect 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 operations waiting their turn on the single-threaded event loop.
 Thus, a scalable Node.js application must have event handlers with no risky
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

side effects,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 while external services must be called upon in C++.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And even if you did a good job in JavaScript, your implementation will not
 in 
\emph on
any way
\emph default
 be more scalable for this use case than by using a thread pool: users still
 need to wait for their requests to complete, and databases still have to
 return results before you can complete those requests.
 There's nothing in an event-driven model that changes these essential facts.
 (It's worth repeating: both Prudence and Node.js use non-blocking I/O servers:
 Node.js being event-driven has nothing to do with that.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can add some parallelism (and make use of more CPU cores) by running
 multiple Node.js processes behind a load balancer, but the problems quickly
 multiply: each process loads its own version of the database driver, with
 its own connection thread pool, which can't be shared with the other Node.js
 processes.
 In Prudence, by contrast, the same pool is trivially shared by all requests.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It should be clear that Node.js is simply the wrong tool for the job.
 So, why is Node.js so misused? One reason is that its raw architecture is
 attractively simple: multi-threaded programming is hard to get right, single-th
readed easy.
 JavaScript, too, is attractive as a language that many programmers already
 know.
 So, despite being a problematic web platform, it's one in which you can
 build web services quickly and with little fuss, and sometimes that's more
 important than scalability or even robustness, especially if the goal is
 to create in-house services.
 But another reason for Node.js' popularity is more worrying: ignorance.
 People who should know better heard that Node.js is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fast
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 because it's 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

asynchronous
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and think that would lead to faster page load-times for web browsers and
 the ability to handle more page hits.
 That's a very wrong conclusion.
 You can do great REST in Node.js, but would have to work against the platform's
 limitations for the scenario.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We believe that Prudence is a much more sensible choice for the RESTful
 web.
 Beyond the basic architecture, also consider Prudence's features aimed
 specifically at scalability, such as

 article, too, which is useful even if you don't choose Prudence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Technology and Ecosystem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Prudence was designed specifically for the JVM, to provide you with access
 to its rich and high-quality ecosystem, to leverage its excellent concurrency
 libraries and monitoring/profiling capabilities, and to be portable and
 integrative.
 The JVM platform is very mature and reliable, as are many of the libraries
 that Prudence uses, such as Jetty, Restlet and 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Hazelcast"
target "http://www.hazelcast.com/"

\end_inset

.
 It's easier to connect C/C++ libraries to Node.js, but on the other hand
 it's easier to write and deploy extensions in Java/Scala/Groovy for Prudence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And Prudence is not just JavaScript: it supports many dynamic languages
 running on top of the JVM---Python, Ruby, PHP, Lua, Groovy and Clojure---as
 well as their respective ecosystems.
 That said, it does give special love to JavaScript: Sincerity comes with
 a 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "rich foundation library"
target "http://threecrickets.com/sincerity/manual/programming/#sincerity-javascript-library"

\end_inset

, offering essentials such as OOP and string interpolation, as well as friendly
 wrappers for powerful JVM services, such as concurrent collections and
 cryptography.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Node.js is JavaScript-centric, and though it has a much younger and narrower
 ecosystem, it is 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "vibrant and quickly growing"
target "https://npmjs.org/"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
No Benchmarks for You
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In terms of sheer computational performance, Node.js has done well to leverage
 the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

browser wars,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which have resulted in very performative JavaScript interpreters and JITs.
 However, it's worth remembering that these engines are really optimized
 for web browser environments, not servers, and have very limited support
 for threading.
 Prudence can run JavaScript on your choice of either 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Nashorn"
target "http://openjdk.java.net/projects/nashorn/"

\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Rhino"
target "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Rhino"

\end_inset

, which can both use the JVM's excellent concurrency management.
 Nashorn is as of this writing still under development, to be released with
 JVM 8 in March 2014 (Prudence already supports it).
 It promises excellent performance, on par with Java code in some cases.
 Rhino is not as fast, but still performs well and is very mature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But a comparative benchmark would make little sense.
 Node.js' single-threaded model really 
\emph on
needs
\emph default
 blazing-fast language performance, as it directly affects its scalability.
 Prudence's multi-threaded model and RESTful expectations mean that it's
 rarely CPU-bound: for example, you spend orders of magnitude more time
 waiting for database backends to respond than for functions to be called.
 For the web page use case, smart architecture---and smart caching---are
 
\emph on
far 
\emph default
more important for scalability than language engine performance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note, too, that all the performance-critical parts of Prudence are written
 in Java, just as they are written in C++ for Node.js.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Choose the right tool for the job! Node.js is a great choice for streaming
 and streaming-like services, and Prudence---we hope you'll agree---is a
 great choice for web services and RESTful APIs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Performance and Scalability
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
How well does Prudence perform? How well does it scale?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, recognize that there are two common uses for the term “scale.” REST
 is often referred to as an inherently scalable architecture, but that has
 more to do with project management than technical effectiveness.
 This difference is addressed in the 
\bar under
“The Case for REST” (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "the-cast-for-rest"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the perspective of the ability to respond to user requests, there are
 three aspects to consider: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
1.
 Serving HTTP
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Prudence comes with 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Jetty"
target "http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/"

\end_inset

, an HTTP server based on the JVM's non-blocking I/O API.
 Jetty handles concurrent HTTP requests very well, and serves static files
 at scales comparable to popular HTTP servers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
2.
 Generating HTML
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Prudence implements what might be the most sophisticated 
\bar under
caching system (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "caching"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
 of any web development framework.
 Caching is truly the key to scalable software.
 See 
\bar under
“Scaling Tips” (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "scaling-tips"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
 for a comprehensive discussion of the role of caching.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
3.
 Running code
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There may be a delay when starting up a specific language engine in Prudence
 for the first time in an application, as it loads and initializes itself.
 Then, there may be a delay when accessing a dynamic web page or resource
 for the first time, or after it has been changed, as it might require compilati
on.
 Once it's up and running, though, your code performs and scale very well---as
 well as you've written it.
 You need to understand concurrency and make sure you make good choices
 to handle coordination between threads accessing the same data.
 If all is good, your code will actually perform better throughout the life
 of the application.
 The JVM learns and adapts as it runs, and performance can improve the more
 the application is used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All language engines supported of Prudence are generally very fast.
 In some cases, the JVM language implementations are faster than their “native”
 equivalents.
 This is demonstrable for Python, Ruby and PHP.
 The reason is that the JVM, soon reaching version 8, is a very mature virtual
 machine, and incorporates decades-worth of optimizations for live production
 environments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you are performing CPU-intensive or time-sensitive tasks, then it's best
 to profile these code segments precisely.
 Exact performance characteristics depend on the language and engine used.
 The 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Bechmarks Game"
target "http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/"

\end_inset

 can give you some comparisons of different language engines running high-comput
ation programs.
 In any case, if you have a piece of intensive code that really needs to
 perform well, it's probably best to write it in Java and access it from
 the your language.
 You can even write it in C or assembly, and have it linked to Java via
 JNI.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you're not doing intensive computation, then don't worry too much about
 your language being “slow.” It's been shown that for the vast majority of
 web applications, the performance of the web programming language is rarely
 the bottleneck.
 The deciding factors are the usually performance of the backend data-driving
 technologies and architectures.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
I heard REST is very scalable.
 Is this true? Does this mean Prudence can support many millions of users?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yes, if you know what you're doing.
 See 
\bar under
“The Case for REST” (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "the-cast-for-rest"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
 for in-depth discussions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bottom line is that it's very easy to make your application scale poorly,
 whatever technology or architecture you use, and that Prudence, in embracing
 REST and the JVM, can more easily allow for best-practice scalable architecture
s than most other web platforms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That's not very reassuring, but it's a fact of software and hardware architectur
e right now.
 Achieving massive scale is challenging.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Errors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
How to avoid the “Adapter not available for language: xml” parsing exception
 for XML files?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem is that the XML header confuses Scripturian, Prudence's language
 parser, which considers the “<?” a possible scriptlet delimiter:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "breaklines=true"
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simple solution is to force Scripturian to use the “<%” for the page
 via an empty scriptlet, ignoring all “<?”:
\end_layout

Licensing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
The author is not a lawyer.
 This is not legal advice, but a personal, and possibly wrong interpretation.
 The wording of the license itself supersedes anything written here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Does the LGPL mean I can't use Prudence unless my product is open sourced?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The GPL family of licenses restrict your ability to 
\emph on
redistribute
\emph default
 software, not to use it.
 You are free to use Prudence as you please within your organization, even
 if you're using it to serve public web sites---though with no warranty
 nor an implicit guarantee of support from the copyright holder, Three Crickets
 LLC.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The GPL would thus only be an issue if you're selling, or even giving away,
 a product that 
\emph on
would include
\emph default
 Prudence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And note that Prudence uses the 
\emph on
Lesser
\emph default
 GPL, which has even fewer restrictions on redistribution than the regular
 GPL.
 Essentially, as long as you do not alter Prudence in any way, you can include
 Prudence in any product, 
\emph on
even if it is not free
\emph default
.
 With one exception: Prudence uses version 3 of the Lesser GPL, which requires
 your product to not restrict users' ownership of data via schemes such
 as DRM if Prudence is to be included in its distribution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even if your product does not qualify for including Prudence in it, you
 always have the option of distributing your product without Prudence, and
 instructing your customers to download and install Prudence on their own.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We understand that in some cases open sourcing your product is impossible,
 and passing the burden to the users is cumbersome.
 As a last resort, we offer you a commercial license as an alternative to
 the GPL.
 Please contact Three Crickets for details.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Three Crickets, the original developers of Prudence, are not trying to force
 you to purchase it.
 That is not our business model, and we furthermore find such trickery bad
 for building trusting relationships.
 Instead, we hope to encourage you to 1) pay Three Crickets for consultation,
 support and development services for Prudence, and to 2) consider releasing
 your own product as free software, thereby truly sharing your innovation
 with all of society.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Why the LGPL and not the GPL?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Lesser GPL used to be called the “Library GPL,” and was originally drafted
 for 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "glibc"
target "http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/"

\end_inset

.
 It is meant for special cases in which the full GPL could limit the adoption
 of a product, which would be self-defeating.
 The assumption is that there are many alternatives with less restrictions
 on distribution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the case of the Linux project, the full GPL has done a wonderful job
 at convincing vendors to open source their code in order to ship their
 products with Linux inside.
 However, it doesn't seem likely that they would do the same for Prudence.
 There are so many great web development platforms out there with fewer
 restrictions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that the LGPL version 3 has a clause allowing you to “upgrade” Prudence
 to the full GPL for inclusion in your GPL-ed product.
 This is a terrific feature, and another reason to love this excellent license.

\begin_layout Subsection
Request URIs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These variables are composed of a prefix and a suffix.
 The prefix specifies which URI you are referring to, while the suffix specifies
 the part of that URI.
 For example, the prefix 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

{r-}
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 can be combined with the suffix 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

{-i}
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

{ri}
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, to specify the complete request URI.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Base URIs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every URI also has a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

base
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 version of it: in the case of wildcard URI templates, it is the URI before
 the wildcard begins.
 Otherwise it is usually the application's root URI on the virtual host.
 It is used in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

{-r}
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

{-e}
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 suffixes above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To refer to the base URI directly, use the special 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

{-b-}
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 infix, to which you would still need to add one of the above suffixes.
 For example, “{rbi}” refers to the complete base URI of the actual URI.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a common use case for redirection, so even though it's included
 in the documentation above, it's worth emphasizing.
 According to the rules, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

*
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 would be the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

{rr}
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 variable.
 For example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false

\begin_layout Plain Layout

app.routes = {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	...

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	'/assets/*': '/files/media/{rr}'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above would capture a URI such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/assets/images/logo.png
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/files/media/images/logo.png

Response Attributes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[these are not supported in capturing or other forms of server-side redirection,
 because redirection happens before a response is actually generated.] [useful
 for cache patterns?]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These are all in uppercase to differentiate them from the request variables:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
{S}: the HTTP status code
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
{SIA}: server IP address
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
{SIP}: server port number
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
{SIG}: server agent name
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
{R-}: the redirection URI (see 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Request URIs
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 above for a list of suffixes, which must also be in uppercase)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additionally, all the entity attributes can be used in uppercase to correspond
 to the response entity.
 For example, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

{ES}
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for the response entity size, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

{EMT}
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for the response media type, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
conversation.locals
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we've seen in the 
\bar under
app.routes guide (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "app-routes"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
, URI templates delimited by curly brackets can be used to parse incoming
 request URIs and extract the values into 
\bar under
conversation.locals (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "conversation-locals"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
.
 For example, a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/person/{id}/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 URI template will match the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/person/linus/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 URI and extract 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

linus
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 into the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

id
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 conversation.local.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But you can also do the opposite: interpolate the values that were extracted
 from the matched URI pattern.
 An example of redirection that both extracts and interpolates:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

app.routes = {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	...
\end_layout

\end_inset

 family of architectural patterns has had great influence over user-interface
 programming and even design.
 At its core is the idea that the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

model
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (the data) and the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

view
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (the user interface) should be decoupled and isolated.
 This essentially good idea allows each layer to be optimized and tested
 on its own.
 It also allows the secondary benefit of easier refactoring in the future,
 in case one of the layers needs to be replaced with a different technology,
 a not uncommon requirement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Forms, Forms, Forms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem is that you need an intermediary; and it could be a big problem.
 Consider that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

classic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 MVC, based around a thick controller layer, isn't as popular as it used
 to be.
 There, the controller does 
\emph on
as much as possible, 
\emph default
under the assumption of predictability, in order to automate the production
 of large, repetitive user interfaces.
 It thus handles form validation, binding of form fields to database columns,
 and even form flows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Forms, forms, as far as the eye can see.
 MVC was, and still is, the domain of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

enterprise
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 user interfaces.
 It's telling that the manipulation of the data model is called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

business logic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: the use case for MVC really is big business for big businesses.
 At its best, MVC makes these repetitive stacks of forms easier to maintain
 in the long run.
 At its worst, programmers drown in an ocean of controller configuration
 files, fighting opaque layers of APIs that can only do what they were programme
d to do, but not what is needed for a sensible UI.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Outside of the big business world, where automation reigns supreme, UI implement
ations use more flexible derivatives of MVC, such as 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Model-View-Presenter (MVP)"
target "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter"

\end_inset

.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

presenter,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 far from an opaque layer, is implemented directly by the programmer in
 code, often by inheriting classes that provide the basic predictable functional
ity.
 Depending on the variation you're using, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

business logic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 might even be in the presenter rather than the model.
 Still, MVP, like MVC, stems from the same anxiety about mixing model and
 view.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
MVC and the Web
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These two do not seem an obvious match.
 The web is RESTful, such that the user interface (the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

view
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) is no different from data (the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

model
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

): both are RESTful resources, implemented similarly.
 In other words, in REST 
\emph on
the model is the view
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, that's only really and entirely true for the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

classic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 web.
 Using JavaScript and other in-browser plugins, we get a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rich
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 web that acts no differently from desktop applications.
 The backend remains RESTful, essentially the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

model,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with controllers/presenters as well as views implemented entirely client-side.
 You can do full-blown, conventional MVC with the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rich
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 web.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MVC, however, has found inroads into the 
\emph on
classic
\emph default
 web: there exist many frameworks that treat web pages as a pure 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

view,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 an approach they go so far as to enforce by allowing you to embed only
 limited templating code into your HTML.
 Some of these frameworks even allow you to configure the form flow, which
 they then use to generate an opaque URI-space for you, and can even sabotage
 the browser 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

back
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 button to enforce that flow.
 (MVC automation at its finest! Or worst\SpecialChar \ldots{}
)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The impetus for these brutally extreme measures is similar to the one with
 which we started: a desire to decouple the user interface from everything
 else.
 HTML is the realm of web designers, not programmers, and mixing the work
 of both professions into a single file presents project management challenges.
 However, there's a productive distance between cleaning up HTML pages and
 full-blown MVC, which unfortunately not enough frameworks explore.
 And actually, not everything called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

MVC
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 really is MVC.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So what are we left with in Prudence? As you'll see, Prudence supports a
 straightforward MVP architecture while still adhering to RESTful principles.
 Read on, and consider if it would benefit your project to use it.
 Our recommendation is to use what works best for you and your development
 team.

Models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Implement this layer according to your preferences and as appropriate to
 the database technology you are using.
 For example, you may want to use object-oriented architecture.
 The model layer as a whole should live in your 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/libraries/

\end_inset

 subdirectory.
 For this example, let's put it under 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Do you want the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

business logic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to live in the model layer? If so, your classes should be of a somewhat
 higher level of abstraction above the actual data structure.
 If you prefer the models to more directly represent the data, then you
 have the option of putting the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

business logic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in your presenters instead.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
There are some who shudder at the thought of mixing dynamic languages and
 HTML.
 This likely comes from bad experience with poorly-designed PHP/JSP/ASP
 applications, where everything gets mixed together into the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

view
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 file.
 If you're afraid of losing control, then you can simply make yourself a
 rule that only templating languages are allowed in scriptlets.
 It's purely a matter of project management discipline.
 We recommend, however, relaxing some of that extremism: for example, you
 can make the rule that no

 should appear together with HTML, while still allowing some flexibility
 for using server-side JavaScript, but 
\emph on

 Still unconvinced? We'll show you below how to

\begin_layout Standard
In Prudence, these are the resources that are actually exposed in the URI-space,
 while the views remain hidden.
 The presenter retrieves the appropriate view and presents it to the user.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can use either manual or scriptlet resources as your presenters.
 However, 
\bar under
manual resources (page

 offer a bit more flexibility, so we will choose them for our example.

\begin_layout Standard
To keep the example succinct, we're only making use of a single view in
 this presenter, though it should be clear that you can use any appropriate
 logic here to retrieve any view using getView.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
getView is where the MVC 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

magic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 happens, but as you can see it's really nothing more than an internal request.
 We're specifically using two special features of internal requests:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We can request URIs that are hidden: in this case, anything under 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/libraries/includes/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We can transfer 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

POST
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 payloads directly using the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

object
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 type.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We'll remind you also that internal requests are 
\emph on
fast
\emph default
.
 They emphatically do not use HTTP, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

object
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

-type payloads are 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 serialized.
\end_layout

Implications for Caching
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Caching of scriptlet resources (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

views
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) works as usual here, though you should take care to remember that the
 request hitting the scriptlet resource is the 
\emph on
internal
\emph default
 one, 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 the external one, which actually hits the presenter.
 If there are attributes of the external request that you want to use for
 the cache key pattern, then you must transfer them manually.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
View Templates
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "view-templates"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One size does not fit all.
 Almost every web framework comes with its own solution to templating, with
 its own idiosyncratic syntax and set of features, manifesting its own templatin
g philosophy.
 As you've probably picked up, Prudence's philosophy is that the programmer
 knows best: scriptlets should be able do 
\emph on
anything
\emph default
, and the programmer doesn't need to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

protected
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 from bad decisions via a dumbed-down, sandboxed templating domain language.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two common counter-arguments, which we don't think are very convincing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first is that the people designing the templates might not, in fact,
 know best: they might not be proficient programmers, but instead web designers
 who specialize in HTML/CSS coding and testing.
 They would be able to deal with a few inserted template codes, but not
 a full-blown programming language.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

real
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 programmers would be writing the controllers/presenters, and injecting
 values into the templates according to the web designers' needs.
 This argument carries less validity than it used to: proficient web designers
 these days need to know JavaScript, and if they can handle client-side
 JavaScript, they should be able to handle server-side JavaScript, too.
 Will they need to learn some new things? Yes, but learning a new templating
 language is no trivial task, either.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second counter-argument is about discipline: even competent programmers
 might be tempted to make 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

shortcuts,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and insert 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

business logic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 into what should be purely a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

view.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 This would short-circuit the MVC separation and create hard-to-manage 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

spaghetti
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 code.
 A restricted templating language could, then, enforce this discipline.
 This seems like a brutal solution: programmers get annoyed if their own
 platforms don't trust them, and in any case can circumvent these restrictions
 by writing plugins that would then do what they need.
 But the real issue is that discipline should be handled as a social issue
 of project management, not by tools.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In any case, we won't force our philosophy on you: Prudence has built in
 support for 
\bar under
two templating engines (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "templating-languages"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
, and it's easy to plug in a wide range of alternative templating engines
 into Prudence.
 If you're familiar and comfortable with a particular one, use it.
 We'll guide you in this section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many templating engines you can use.
 The best performing and most minimal solutions are pure JVM libraries:
 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "StringTemplate"
target "http://www.stringtemplate.org/"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Thymeleaf"
target "http://www.thymeleaf.org/"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Snippetory"
target "http://www.jproggy.org/snippetory/"

\end_inset

.
 However, the most popular ones use other languages, for example 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Jinja2"
target "http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/"

\end_inset

 for Python.
 Below are examples per each type.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The technique we'll show for using both types is the same: writing a 
\bar under
custom dispatcher (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "custom-dispatchers"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
, so make sure you understand dispatching before you continue to read.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
StringTemplate Example
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "stringtemplate"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this example, we chose 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "StringTemplate"
target "http://www.stringtemplate.org/"

\end_inset

: it's very minimal, and stringently espouses a philosophy entirely opposite
 to Prudence's: proof that Prudence is not forcing you into a paradigm!
 We'll of course use the Java/JVM port, though note that StringTemplate
 is also ported to other languages.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The StringTemplate API is very straightforward and this code should be easy
 to follow.
 Notes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We've allowed only internal requests through: we want to hide this dispatcher
 from the public URI space because it should only accessed by our presenters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We're stripping trailing slashes from the ID because STRawGroupDir doesn't
 support them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We've switched to the older 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

$
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 delimiters because the default 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

<
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

>
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 delimiters are awkward to use with HTML.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
STRawGroupDir does not pick up template file changes on-the-fly, so we're
 recreating it per request.
 Because it caches compiled templates, it would be more efficient to make
 it a global, but they you would have to find an alternative way for invalidatin
g it for live application edits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now for our routing.js:

See how we've

\end_inset

)
\bar default
 into 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

{rr}
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: this means that a URI such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/views/hello/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 would translate to the ID 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hello
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's create our template, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/libraries/views/user/comments.st
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false

\begin_layout Plain Layout

<html>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

<body>

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	</table>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

</body>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

</html>
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note the use of an anonymous template (a lambda).
 As an alternative, we can also use named templates, which we can to group
 into reusable libraries.
 This is easy to do with 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "group files"
target "http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ST4/Group+file+syntax"

\end_inset

.
 With that, here's an alternative definition of the above, saved as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/libraries/views/user.stg
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false

\begin_layout Plain Layout

comments(username, comments) ::= <<
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

<html>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

<body>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	<p>These are the comments for user: $username$</p>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	<table>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		$comments:row()$
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	</table>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

</body>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

</html>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

row(content) ::= <<
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

<tr><td>$content$</td></tr>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

>>
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that STRawGroupDir treats these 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

.stg
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 files as if they were a directory with multiple files when you look up
 an ID, so the URI to access 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

comments
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 would be the same in both cases: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/views/users/comments/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, our presenters would work the same as in the 
\bar under
MVC tutorial (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "mvc-presenters"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
.
 The only change would be to flatten out the contexts for StringTemplate
 to use:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

var person = Models.getPerson(name)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

return getView('comments', {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	username: person.getUsername(),
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	comments: person.getComments().get()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

})
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That's it!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Caching?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not with StringTemplate, unfortunately.
 Its brutal rejection of any kind of programming logic in templates means
 that you can't create a plugin to support caching.
 Your only option would be to cache the views yourself in the presenter,
 or even use an 
\bar under
upstream cache (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "scaling-tips-upstream-caching"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
.
 In our next example, we'll be using a more flexible engine that allows
 for more integration with Prudence features.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Jinja2 Example
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "jinja2"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Jinja2"
target "http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/"

\end_inset

 is an embeddable engine that mimics the well-known template syntax of the
 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Django framework"
target "https://www.djangoproject.com/"

\end_inset

.
 We'll go over its basic integration into Prudence, and also show you how
 to write Jinja2 custom tags to easily take advantage of Prudence's 
\bar under
caching mechanism (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "caching"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First we need to install 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Python"
target "http://threecrickets.com/sincerity/ecosystem/language-plugins/#python-plugin"

\end_inset

 and Jinja2 in our container:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

sincerity add python : install : easy_install Jinja2==2.6 simplejson
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We're also installing the 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "simplejson"
target "http://simplejson.readthedocs.org/"

\end_inset

 library, because Jython doesn't come with the JSON support we'll need (more
 on that later).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Note that Jinja2 version 2.7 doesn't work in Jython (might be fixed for version
 2.8), but version 2.6 does, so that's what we use here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For our dispatcher, we'll do something a bit different from before: because
 we want to support caching of templates, we will want the actual template
 renderer as a 
\bar under
scriptlet resource (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "scriptlet-resources"

\end_inset

)
\bar default

\begin_layout Itemize
We've allowed only internal requests through: we want to hide this dispatcher
 from the public URI space because it should only be accessed by our presenters.

\begin_layout Itemize
Jinja2's FileSystemLoader requires the full filename, so we're stripping
 trailing slashes and adding 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

.html

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We're forwarding a few useful attributes of the request: the original URI
 and the original base URI.
 We'll show you later how to use those for our custom tags.

 Avoiding serialization is fine for Python-to-Python calls, but if we call
 from another programming language---say, JavaScript---the native structures
 are incompatible.
 Thus, we're allowing the use of JSON as an interchange format.
 On the other side, when we send the payload to

\begin_layout Subsection
RESTful Models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our MVC tutorial above, we've implemented our models as classes (OOP).
 However, it may make sense to implement them as RESTful resources instead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Doing so allows for powerful deployment flexibility: it would be possible
 to decouple the model layer entirely, over HTTP.
 For example, you could have 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

model servers
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 running at one data center, close to the database servers, while 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

presentation servers
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 run elsewhere, providing the direct responses to users.
 In this scenario, the presenters would be calling the models using secured
 HTTP requests, instead of function calls.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even if you're not planning for such flexibility at the moment, it might
 still be a good idea to allow for it in the future.
 Until then, you could optimize by treating the model layer as an 
\bar under
internal API (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "internal-uri-space"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
, which makes it about as fast as function calls.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two potential downsides to a RESTful model layer.
 First, there's the added programming complexity: it's easier to create
 a class than a resource.
 Second, RESTful resources are limited to four verbs: though GET/POST/PUT/DELETE
 might be enough for most CRUD operations, it can prove harder to design
 a RESTful URI-space for complex 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

business logic.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A good compromise, if necessary, can be to still use HTTP to access models,
 just not RESTfully: use Remote Procedure Call (RPC) instead.
 We discuss this option in the 
\bar under
URI-space architecture tips (page

In Prudence,

filters
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 are 
\bar under
route types (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "filtering-route-types"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
 used to add effects to resources.
 Though you can often code the same effect directly into a resource, filters
 are decoupled from resources, allowing you to reuse an effect on many resources
, which is especially useful with 
\bar under
mapping route types (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "mapping-route-types"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, filters are the 
\emph on

way to add effects to 
\bar under
static resources (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref

\end_inset

)
\bar default
, which cannot themselves be programmed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because it's easy to enable and disable filters just by editing routing.js,
 filters are often used to add debugging and testing effects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Tutorial
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Filters are implemented similarly to 
\bar under
manual resources (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "manual-resources"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
: as source code files (in any supported language) with either or both filter
 entry points: handleBefore and handleAfter.
 The former is called before all requests reach the next (downstream) route
 type, and the latter is called on the way back, after the downstream finishes
 its work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's start with configuring our filter, using the 
\bar under

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

filter
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 route type (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "filter-route-type"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
 in routing.js.
 We'll put it in front of all our main mapping resources:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

app.routes = {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	'/*': {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		type: 'filter',
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		library: '/my-filter/',
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		next: [
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

			'manual',
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

			'scriptlet',
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

			'static'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now let's create the actual filter in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/libraries/my-filter.js
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 We'll start with a trivial handleAfter implementation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

function handleAfter(conversation) {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	application.logger.info('We got a request for a resource at: ' + conversation.refe
rence)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our filter doesn't do much yet, but it's easy to test that the code is being
 called by looking at the log.
 Of course you can do many other things here, as detailed in the examples
 below.
 Most of the 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "conversation APIs"
target "http://threecrickets.com/api/javascript/?namespace=conversation"

\end_inset

 are available to you, including the redirection APIs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that while you need to restart your application for the changes in
 routing.js to take hold, you are free to edit my-filter.js and have the changes
 picked up on-the-fly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
handleBefore is a bit more sophisticated than handleAfter, in that it also
 requires a return value:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

function handleBefore(conversation) {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	application.logger.info('We got a request for a resource at: ' + conversation.refe
rence)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	return 'continue'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Three literal return values are supported, as either a string or a number:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

continue” or 0
\series default
: Continue to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

next
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 handler
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\series bold
skip” or 1
\series default
: Skip the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

next
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 route type and go immediately to our own handleAfter
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

stop” or 2
\series default
: Stop 
\emph on
our
\emph default
 handling altogether: the same as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

skip,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but handleAfter is 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 called (note that if a filter was installed 
\emph on
before
\emph default
 us, it would still be called)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Again, you may define both a handleBefore and a handleAfter in the same
 filter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Examples
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Changing the Request
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It may be useful to change user requests for testing purposes.
 Specifically, we can affect content negotiation by changing the accepted
 formats declared by the user.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, let's say we want to disable compression for all resources,
 even if clients declare that they are capable of handling it:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

function handleBefore(conversation) {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	conversation.client.acceptedEncodings.clear()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	return 'continue'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Easy! Note that this would be 
\emph on
much
\emph default
 harder to achieve retroactively, by changing the response: we would have
 to decompress all compressed responses.
 Some effects are much better implemented in handleBefore.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Overriding the Response
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Filters can be useful for overriding the response under certain conditions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following example always sets the response to a web page displaying
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

blocked!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, unless a special 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

admin
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\bar under
cookie (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "cookies"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
 is used with a magic value.
 It can be used to make sure that certain resources are unavailable for
 users who are not administrators:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

function handleAfter(conversation) {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	if (!isAuthorized(conversation)) {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		var content = '<html><body>' + conversation.reference + ' is blocked to
 you!</body></html>'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		conversation.setResponseText(content, 'text/html', 'en', 'UTF-8')
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

function isAuthorized(conversation) {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	var cookie = conversation.getCookie('admin')
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	return (null !== cookie) && (cookie.value == 'magic123')
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another, simpler trick, would be to redirect the response:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

function handleAfter(conversation) {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	if (!isAuthorized(conversation)) {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		conversation.redirectSeeOther(conversation.base + '/blocked/')
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\series bold
Note on 
\emph on
changing
\emph default
 the response:
\series default
 You might think that filters could be useful to affect the content of responses
, for example to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

filter out
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 data from HTML pages.
 Actually, Prudence filters are 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 a good way to do this, because there's no guarantee that response payloads
 returned from downstream resources are textual, even if the content is
 text: they could very well be compressed (gzip) and also chunked.
 You would then need to decode, disassemble, make your changes, and then
 reassemble such responses, which is neither trivial nor efficient.
 
\emph on
Content
\emph default
 filtering should best be handled at the level of the resource code itself,
 
\emph on
before 
\emph default
the response payload is created.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Side Effects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Filters don't have to change anything about the request or the response.
 They can be useful for gathering statistics or other debugging information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this example, we'll gather statistics about agent self-identification:
 specifically web browser product names and operating systems (via the 
\begin_inset CommandInset href

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	getCounter('agent', agent).incrementAndGet()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	getCounter('os', os).incrementAndGet()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	logger.info('Agent stats: ' + application.globals.get('counters.agent'))
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	logger.info('OS stats: ' + application.globals.get('counters.os'))
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	return 'continue'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

function getCounter(section, name) {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	var counters = application.getGlobal('counters.' + section, new ConcurrentHashMap
())
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	var counter = counters.get(name)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	if (null === counter) {

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	return counter
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here we're storing statistics in memory and sending them to the log, but
 for your uses you might prefer to store them in a database using atomic
 operations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Built-in Filters
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Prudence comes with a few built-in filters, each with 
\bar under
its own route type (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "filtering-route-types"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
.
 Many of them are useful specifically with 
\bar under
static resources (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "static-resources"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
, and are discussed in that chapter.
 A few others are more generally useful, and are discussed here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Inversion of Control (IoC) via Injection
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "ioc"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You already know that you can configure parts of your application via 
\bar under
application.global presets (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "app-globals"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
.
 Globals,of course, affect the entire application.
 However, you may sometimes need 
\emph on
local 
\emph default
configurations: the ability to a specific instance of a resources differently
 from others.
 That's where the 
\bar under

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

injector
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 route type (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "injector-route-type"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
 comes in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that because IoC is most often used together with capturing and dispatching
, there is a shortcut notation to apply to the 
\bar under

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

capture
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dispatch
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 route types (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "resource-dispatching-ioc"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
.
 However, you can also use injection independently.
 An example for routing.js:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

app.routes = {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	'/user/{name}/': {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		next: '@user'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To access the injected value in your resource code, simply use the 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "conversation.locals API"
target "http://threecrickets.com/api/javascript/?namespace=conversation&item=conversation.locals"

\end_inset

\begin_layout Plain Layout

if (deployment == 'production') {
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
You can inject any kind of object using an injector, though keep in mind
 that the native types of JavaScript may not be easily accessible in other
 programming languages.
 For example, if you're injecting a dict or an array, it would not be automatica
lly converted to, say, a Python dict or vector.
 However, primitive types such as strings and numbers would be OK for all
 supported languages.
\end_layout

 At the simplest, you just add a new file and assign a port for it.
 A minimal server definition for HTTP:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings

\begin_layout Plain Layout

var server = new Server(Protocol.HTTP, 8080)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can also bind a server to a specific IP address, in case your machine
 has more than one IP address:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings

\begin_layout Plain Layout

server.address = [string]
\end_layout

\end_layout

There are also many configuration parameters for Jetty, the HTTP engine,
 which you can set in the server's context.
 Here we'll increase the size of the thread pool and lower the idle timeout:

If you are using a

\bar default
, it may make sense to handle secure connections there.
 But Prudence can also handle secure (HTTPS) connections itself.
 Here's an example configuration for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

:
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

server.context.parameters.set('useForwardedForHeader', 'true')
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
See 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "DefaultSslContextFactory"
target "http://restlet.org/learn/javadocs/2.2/jse/ext/index.html?org/restlet/ext/ssl/DefaultSslContextFactory.html"

\end_inset

 for all security configuration parameters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Security Keys
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above configuration assumes the you have a Java KeyStore (JKS) file
 at “/path/prudence.jks” containing your security key.
 You can create a key using the 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "“keytool” utility"
target "http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/tooldocs/index.html#security"

\end_inset

 that is bundled with most JVMs.
 For example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "breaklines=true"
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

keytool -keystore /path/prudence.jks -alias mykey -genkey -keyalg RSA
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When creating the keystore, you will be asked provide a password for it,
 and you may optionally provide a password for your key, too, in which case
 you need to comment out the relevant line in the example above.
 (The key alias and key password would be transferred together with the
 key if you move it to a different keystore.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such self-created keys are useful for controlled intranet environments,
 in which you can provide clients with the public key, but for Internet
 applications you will likely want a key created by one of the “certificate
 authorities” trusted by most web browsers.
 Some of these certificate authorities may conveniently let you download
 a key in JKS format.
 Otherwise, if they support PKCS12 format, you can use keytool (only JVM
 version 6 and later) to convert PKCS12 to JKS.
 For example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "breaklines=true"
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

keytool -importkeystore -srcstoretype PKCS12 -srckeystore /path/prudence.pkcs12
 -destkeystore /path/prudence.jks
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If your certificate authority won't even let you download PKCS12 file, you
 can create one from your “.key” and “.crt” (or “.pem”) files using 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "OpenSSL"
target "http://www.openssl.org/"

\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "breaklines=true"
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

openssl pkcs12 -inkey /path/mykey.key -in /path/mykey.crt -export -out /path/prude
nce.pkcs12 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(Note that in this case you 
\emph on
must
\emph default
 give your new PKCS12 a non-empty password, or else keytool will fail with
 an unhelpful error message.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Handling HTTPS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's sometimes necessary to support HTTPS specially in your implementation.
 One useful strategy is to create separate applications for HTTP and HTTPS,
 and then attach them to different 
\bar under
virtual hosts (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "hosts"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
, one for each protocol (the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

resourceScheme
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 parameter).
 However, if the application behaves mostly the same for HTTP and HTTPS,
 but differs only in a few specific resources, it may be useful to check
 for HTTPS programmatically, via the 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "conversation.reference.schemeProtocol API"
target "http://threecrickets.com/api/javascript/?namespace=conversation&item=conversation.reference"

\end_inset

.
 For example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "breaklines=true"
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

if (conversation.reference.schemeProtocol.name == 'HTTPS') {

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The Hungry Host
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

default
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 host that comes with the Prudence skeleton doesn't configure any routing
 limitations, meaning that 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 incoming requests are routed.
 We call such a host 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hungry.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Thus, if you want to use more than one host, you have to make sure that
 the hungry host is the 
\emph on
last
\emph default
 one, so that it acts as a fallback for when other hosts don't match incoming
 requests.
 Otherwise, it would 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

eat
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 requests from other hosts.
 Because host files are executed in alphabetical order, a good way to ensure
 that the hungry host is last is to number your host filenames.
 For example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
1-public.js
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
2-private.js
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
3-default.js (this is the hungry host)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Deploying Multiple Sites
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using the virtual hosts and application model, Prudence can let you manage
 several sites using a single Prudence installation (a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

container
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 But is this always a good idea?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Advantages of Using a Single Container
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Possibly simpler deployment: you are using a single base directory for the
 entire project, which might be easier for you.
 Because all configuration is done by JavaScript inside the container, it
 is very flexible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Less memory use than running multiple JVMs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Shared memory: you can use application.sharedGlobals to share state between
 applications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Advantages of Using Multiple Containers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Possibly simpler deployment: several base directories can mean separate
 code/distribution repositories, which might be easier for you.
 Configuration will be at your web frontend (reverse proxy).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Robustness: crashes/deadlocks/memory leaks in one VM won't affect others.
 With this in mind, it may even be worth having each 
\emph on
single application
\emph default
 running in its own JVM/container.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Run-time flexibility: you can restart the JVM for one container without
 affecting others that are running.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is no performance advantage in either scenario.
 Everything in Prudence is designed around high-concurrency and threading,
 and generally threads are managed by the OS globally.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Well, there are caveats to that statement: Linux can group threads per running
 process for purposes of prioritization, but this is only really done for
 desktop applications.
 The feature could be possibly useful when running several containers, if
 you want to guarantee high thread priority to one of the containers over
 the others.
 Any of this would only effect 
\emph on
very
\emph default
 high concurrency and highly CPU-bound deployments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Routing In-Depth
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "routing-in-depth"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this final section, we'll describe in detail how routing works in Prudence.
 It can be considered optional, advanced reading.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Prudence, “routing” refers to the decision-making process by which an
 incoming client request reaches its server-side handler .
 Usually, information in the request itself is used to make the decision,
 such as the URI, cookies, the client type, capabilities and geolocation.
 But routing can also take server-side and other circumstances into account.
 For example, a round-robin load-balancing router might send each incoming
 request to a different handler in sequence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A request normally goes through many route types before reaching its handler.
 Filters along the way can change information in the request, which could
 also affect routing, and indeed filters can be used as routing tools.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This abstract, flexible routing mechanism is one of Prudence's most powerful
 features, but it's important to understand these basic principles.
 A common misconception is that routing is based on the hierarchical structure
 of URIs, such that a child URI's routing is somehow affected by its parent
 URI.
 While it's possible to explicitly design your routes hierarchically, routing
 is primarily to be understood in terms of the order of routers and filters
 along the way.
 A parent and child URI could thus use entirely different handlers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To give you a better understanding of how Prudence routing works, let's
 follow the journey of a request, starting with routing at the server level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Step 1: Servers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Requests come in from servers.
 Prudence instances have at the minimum one server, but can have more than
 one.
 Each server listens at a particular HTTP port, and multiple servers may
 in turn be restricted to particular network interfaces on your machine.
 By default, Prudence has a single server that listens to HTTP requests
 on port 8080 coming in from all network interfaces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Step 2: The Component
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is only one component per Prudence instance, and 
\emph on
all 
\emph default
servers route to it.
 This allows Prudence a unified mechanism to deal with all incoming requests.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Step 3: Virtual Hosts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The component's router decides which virtual host should receive the request.
 The decision is often made according to the domain name in the URL, but
 can also take into account which server it came from.
 Virtual hosting is a tool to let you host multiple sites on the same Prudence
 instance, but it can be used for more subtle kinds of routing, too.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the minimum you must have one virtual host.
 By default, Prudence has one that accepts all incoming requests from all
 servers.
 If you have multiple servers and want to treat them differently, you can
 create a virtual host for each.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Step 4: Applications
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using app.hosts, you can configure which virtual hosts your application will
 be attached to, and the base URI for the application on each virtual host.
 An application can accept requests from several virtual hosts at once.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To put it another way, there's a many-to-many relationship between virtual
 hosts and applications: one host can have many applications, and the same
 application can be attached to many hosts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that you can create a “nested” URI scheme for your applications.
 For example, one application might be attached at the root URI at a certain
 virtual host, “/”, while other applications might be at different URIs
 beneath the root, “/wackywiki” and “/wackywiki/support/forum”.
 The root application will not “steal” requests from the other applications,
 because the request is routed to the right application by the virtual host.
 The fact that the latter URI is the hierarchical descendant of the former
 makes no difference to the virtual host router.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
A Complete Route
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's assume a client from the Internet send a request to URI “http://www.wacky.or
g/wackywicki/support/forum/thread/12/.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our machine has two network interfaces, one facing the Internet and one
 facing the intranet, and we have two servers to listen on each.
 This particular request has come in through the external server.
 The request reachers the component's router.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have a few virtual hosts: one to handle “www.wacky.org”, our organization's
 main site, and another to handle “support.wacky.org”, a secure site where
 paying customers can open support tickets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our forum application (in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/applications/forum/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 subdirectory) is attached to both virtual hosts, but at different URIs.
 It's at “www.wacky.org/wackywiki/support/forum” and at “support.wacky.org/forum”.
 In this case, our request is routed to the first virtual host.
 Though there are a few applications installed at this virtual host, our
 request follows the route to the forum application.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The remaining part of the URI, “/thread/12/” will be further routed inside
 the forum application, according to route types installed in its routing.js.

Upgrading from Prudence 1.1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Prudence 1.1 did not use Sincerity: instead, it was a self-contained container
 with everything in the box.
 This meant it could also not be modular, and instead supported several
 distributions (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

flavors
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) per supported programming language.
 Because of this, it allowed you to use any programming language for your
 bootstrapping code, and indeed the project maintained a separate set of
 bootstrapping code for all languages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This was not only cumbersome in terms of documentation and maintenance,
 but it also made it hard to port applications between 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

flavors.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the move to Sincerity in Prudence 2.0, it was possible to make Prudence
 more minimal as well as more modular, as Sincerity handles the bootstrapping
 and installation of supported languages.
 Though Sincerity can ostensibly run bootstrapping scripts in any Scripturian-su
pported language, it standardizes on JavaScript in order to maintain focus
 and portability.
 The bottom line is that if you used non-JavaScript flavors of Prudence
 1.1, you will need to use JavaScript for your bootstrapping scripts, even
 if your application code (resources, scriptlets, tasks, etc.) is written
 in a different language.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To be 100% clear: 
\emph on
all 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

flavors
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 supported in Prudence 1.1 are still supported in Prudence 2.0
\emph default
, and your application code will likely not even have to change.
 You 
\emph on
only
\emph default
 need (or rather, are recommended) to use JavaScript for bootstrapping.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Upgrading Applications
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are no significant API changes between Prudence 1.1 and Prudence 2.0.
 However, the bootstrapping and configuration has been completely overhauled.
 You will likely need to take a few minutes to rewrite your settings.js,
 routing.js, etc.
 Here is a step-by-step checklist:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Start with a new application based on the default template.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Rename old application (add 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

-old
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

), for example: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

myapp-old
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Use the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 tool to create a new application for your application name:
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

sincerity prudence create myapp
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Copy over individual settings from settings.js, using 
\bar under
the new manual (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "configuring-applications"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
 to find equivalences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Redo your routing.js, using 
\bar under
the new manual (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "configuring-component"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
 to find equivalences.
 Prudence 2.0 uses a far more powerful and clearer routing configuration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Rename 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

/resources/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 files to add a

The Case for REST
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There's a lot of buzz about REST, but also a lot confusion about what it
 is and what it's good for.
 This essay attempts to convey REST's simple essence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's start, then, not at REST, but at an attempt to create a new architecture
 for building scalable applications.
 Our goals are for it to be minimal, straightforward, and still have enough
 features to be productive.
 We want to learn some lessons from the failures of other, more elaborate
 and complicated architectures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's call ours a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

resource-oriented architecture.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Resources
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our base unit is a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

resource,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which, like an object in object-oriented architectures, encapsulates data
 with some functionality.
 However, we've learned from object-orientation that implementing arbitrary
 interfaces is a recipe for complexity: proxy generation, support for arbitrary
 types, marshaling, etc.
 All that often requires a middleware layer to handle the protocol.
 So, instead, we'll keep it simple and define a limited, unified interface
 that would be just useful enough.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From our experience with relational databases, we've learned that a tremendous
 amount of power can be found in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

CRUD
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: Create, Read, Update and Delete.
 If we support just these operations, our resources will already be very
 powerful, enjoying the accumulated wisdom and design patterns from the
 database world.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Identifiers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, let's start with a way of uniquely identifying our resources.
 We'll define a name-based address space where our resources live.
 Each resource is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

attached
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to one or more addresses.
 We'll allow for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as a customary separator to allow for hierarchical addressing schemes.
 For example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "breaklines=true"
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

/animal/dog/3/
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

/animal/cat/12/image/
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

/animal/cat/12/image/large/
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

/animal/cat/12/specs/
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the above, we've allowed for different kinds of animals, a way of referencing
 individual animals, and a way of referencing specific aspects of these
 animals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's now go over CRUD operations in increasing order of complexity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Delete
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Delete
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is the most trivial operation.
 After sending 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

delete
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to an identifier, we expect it to not exist anymore.
 Whether sub-resources in our hierarchy can exist or not, we'll leave up
 to individual implementations.
 For example, deleting 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/animal/cat/12/image
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 may or may not delete 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/animal/cat/12/image/large
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that we don't care about atomicity here, because we don't expect anything
 to happen after our 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

delete
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 operation.
 A million changes can happen to our cat before our command is processed,
 but they're all forgotten after 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

delete.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (See 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

update,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 below, for a small caveat.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Read
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Read
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a bit more complicated than 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

delete.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Since our resource might be changed by other clients, too, we want to make
 sure that there's some kind of way to mark which version we are reading.
 This will allow us to avoid unnecessary reads if there hasn't been any
 change.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, we'll need our resource-oriented architecture to support some kind
 of version tagging feature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Update
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

update
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is that it always references a certain version that we have 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

read” before.
 In some cases, though not all, we need some way to make sure that the data
 we expect to be there hasn't changed since we've last “read” it.
 Let's call this a “conditional update.” (In databases, this is called a
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

compare-and-set
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 atomic operation.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Actually, we've oversimplified our earlier definition of “delete.” In some
 cases, we'd want a “conditional delete” to depend on certain expectations
 about the data.
 We might not want the resource deleted in some cases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We'll need our resource-oriented architecture to support a general “conditional”
 operation feature.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Create
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is our most complex operation.
 Our first problem is that our identifier might not exist yet, or might
 already be attached to a resource.
 One approach could be to try identifiers in sequence:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "breaklines=true"
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Create: /animal/cat/13/ -> Error, already exists
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Create: /animal/cat/14/ -> Error, already exists
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Create: /animal/cat/15/ -> Error, already exists
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Create: /animal/cat/302041/ -> Success!
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Obviously, this is not a scalable solution.
 Another approach could be to have a helper resource which provides us with
 the necessary ID:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "breaklines=true"
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Read: /animal/cat/next/ -> 14
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Create: /animal/cat/14/ -> Oops, someone else beat us to 14!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Read: /animal/cat/next/ -> 15
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Create: /animal/cat/15/ -> Success!
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, we can also have “/animal/cat/next” return unique IDs (such as
 GUIDs) to avoid duplications.
 If we never create our cat, they will be wasted, though.
 The main problem with this approach is that it requires two calls per creation:
 a “read,” and then a “create.” We can handle this in one call by allowing
 for “partial” creation, a “create” linked with an intrinsic “read”:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "breaklines=true"
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Create: /animal/cat/ -> We send the data for the cat without the ID, and
 get back the same cat with an ID
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other solutions exist, too.
 The point of this discussion is to show you that “create” is not trivial,
 but also that solutions to “create” already exist within the resource-oriented
 architecture we've defined.
 “Create,” though programmatically complex, does not require any additional
 architectural features.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Aggregate Resources
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At first glance, handling the problem of getting lots of resources at the
 same time, thus saving on the number of calls, can trivially be handled
 by the features we've listed so far.
 A common solution is to define a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

plural” version of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

singular” resource:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "breaklines=true"
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

/animal/cats/
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A “read” would give us all cats.
 But what if there are ten million cats? We can support paging.
 Again, we have a solution within our current feature set, using identifiers
 for each subset of cats:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "breaklines=true"
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

/animal/cats/100/200/
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can define the above to return no more than 100 cats: from the 100th,
 to the 200th.
 There's a slight problem in this solution: the burden is on whatever component
 in our system handles mapping identifiers to resources.
 This is not terrible, but if we want our system to be more generic, it
 could help if things like “100 to 200” could be handled by our resource
 more directly.
 For convenience, let's implement a simple parameter system for all commands:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "breaklines=true"
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Read(100, 200): /animal/cats/
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the above, our mapping component only needs to know about “/animal/cats”.
 The dumber our mapping component is, the easier it is to implement.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Formats
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem of supporting multiple formats seems similar, at first glance,
 to that of aggregate resources.
 Again, we could potentially solve it with command parameters:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "breaklines=true"
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Read(UTF-8, Russian): /animal/cat/13/
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This would give us a Russian, Unicode UTF-8 encoded version of our cat.
 Looks good, except that there is a potential problem: the client might
 prefer certain formats, but actually be able to handle others.
 It's more a matter of preference than any precision.
 Of course, we can have another resource where all available formats are
 listed, but this would require an extra call, and also introduce the problem
 of atomicity---what if the cat changes between these calls? A better solution
 would be to have the client associate certain preferences per command,
 have our resource emit its capabilities, with the mapping component in
 between “negotiating” these two lists.
 This “negotiation” is a rather simple algorithm to choose the best mutually
 preferable format.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This would be a simple feature to add to our resource-oriented architecture,
 which could greatly help to decouple its support for multiple formats from
 its addressing scheme.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Shared State
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Shared state between the client and server is very useful for managing sessions
 and implementing basic security.
 Of course, it's quite easy to abuse shared state, too, by treating it as
 a cache for data.
 We don't want to encourage that.
 Instead, we just want a very simple shared state system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We'll allow for this by attaching small, named, shared state objects to
 every request and response to a command.
 Nothing fancy or elaborate.
 There is a potential security breach here, so we have to trust that all
 components along the way honor the relationship between client and server,
 and don't allow other servers access to our shared state.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Summary of Features
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, what do we need?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We need a way to map identifiers to resources.
 We need support for the four CRUD operations.
 We need support for “conditional” updates and deletes.
 We need all operations to support “parameters.” We need “negotiation” of
 formats.
 And, we need a simple shared state attachment feature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This list is very easy to implement.
 It requires very little computing power, and no support for generic, arbitrary
 additions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Transactions\SpecialChar \ldots{}
 Not!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before we go on, it's worth mentioning one important feature which we did
 not require: transactions.
 Transactions are optional, and sometimes core features in many databases
 and distributed object systems.
 They can be extremely powerful, as they allow atomicity across an arbitrary
 number of commands.
 They are also, however, heavy to implement, as they require considerable
 shared state between client and server.
 Powerful as they are, it is possible to live without them.
 For example, we can implement complex atomicity schemes ourselves within
 a single resource.
 This puts some burden on us, but it does remove the heavy burden of supporting
 arbitrary transactions from our architecture.
 With some small reluctance, then, we'll do without transactions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Let's Do It!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OK, so now we know what we need, let's go ahead and implement the infrastructure
 of components to handle our requirements.
 All we need is stacks for all supported clients, backend stacks for all
 our potential server platforms, middleware components to handle all the
 identifier routing, content negotiation, caching of data\SpecialChar \ldots{}

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\SpecialChar \ldots{}
And thousands of man hours to develop, test, deploy, and integrate.
 Like any large-scale, enterprise architecture, even trivial requirements
 have to jump through the usual hoops set up by the sheer scale of the task.
 Behind every great architecture are the nuts and bolts of the infrastructure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Wouldn't it be great if the infrastructure already existed?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The Punchline
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, duh.
 
\emph on
All
\emph default
 the requirements for our resource-oriented architecture are already supported
 by HTTP:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our resource identifiers are URLs.
 The CRUD operations are in the four HTTP verbs: PUT, GET, POST and DELETE.
 “Conditional” and “negotiated” modes are handled by headers, as are “cookies”
 for shared state.
 Version stamps are e-tags and timestamps.
 Command parameters are query matrices appended to URLs.
 It's all there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most importantly, the infrastructure for HTTP is already fully 
\emph on
deployed
\emph default
 world-wide.
 TCP/IP stacks are part of practically every operating system; wiring, switching
 and routing are part and parcel; HTTP gateways, firewalls, load balancers,
 proxies, caches, filters, etc., are stable consumer components; certificate
 authorities, national laws, international agreements are already in place
 to support the complex inter-business interaction.
 Best of all, this available infrastructure is successfully maintained,
 with minimal down-time, by highly-skilled independent technicians, organization
s and component vendors across the world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
It's important to note a dependency and possible limitation of HTTP: it
 is bound to TCP/IP.
 Indeed, all identifiers are URLs: Uniform Resource Locators.
 In URLs, the first segment is reserved for the domain, either an IP address
 or a domain name translatable to an IP address.
 Compare this with the more general URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers),
 which do not have this requirement.
 Though we'll often be tied to HTTP in REST, you'll see the literature attemptin
g, at least, to be more generic.
 There are definitely use cases for non-HTTP, and even non-TCP/IP addressing
 schemes.
 In Prudence, it's possible to address internal resources with URIs 
\emph on
that are not URLs

\begin_layout Subsection
It's All About Infrastructure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most important lesson to take from this exercise is the importance of
 infrastructure, something easily forgotten when planning architecture in
 ideal, abstract terms.
 This is why, I believe, Roy Fielding named 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Chapter 5 of his 2000 dissertation"
target "http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm"

\end_inset

 “Representational State Transfer (REST)” rather than, say, “resource-oriented
 architecture,” as we have here.
 Fielding, one of the authors of the HTTP protocol, was intimately familiar
 with its deployment challenges, and the name “REST” is intended to point
 out the key characteristic of its infrastructure: HTTP and similar protocols
 are designed for transferring lightly annotated data representations, nothing
 more.
 “Resources” are merely logical encapsulations of these representations,
 depending on a contract between client and server.
 The infrastructure does not, in itself, do anything in particular to maintain,
 say, a sensible hierarchy of addresses, abitrary atomicity of CRUD operations,
 etc.
 That's up to your implementation.
 But, representational state transfer---REST---is the mundane, underlying
 magic that makes it all possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To come back to where we started: a resource-oriented architecture requires
 a REST infrastructure.
 In practice, the two terms become interchangeable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The principles of resource-orientation can and are applied in many systems.
 The word wide web, of course, with its ecology of web browsers, web servers,
 certificate authorities, etc., is the most obvious model.
 But other core Internet systems, such as email (SMTP, POP, IMAP), file
 transfer (FTP, WebDAV) also implement some subset of REST.
 Your application can do this, too, and enjoy the same potential for scalability
 as these global, open implementations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Does REST Scale?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Part of the buzz about REST is that it's an inherently scalable architecture.
 This is true, but perhaps not in the way that you think.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider that there are two uses of the word “scalable”:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, it's 
\series bold
the ability to respond to a growing number of user requests without degradation
 in response time
\series default
, by “simply” adding hardware (horizontal scaling) or replacing it with
 more powerful hardware (vertical scaling).
 This is the aspect of scalability that engineers care about.
 The simple answer is that REST can help, but it doesn't stand out.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "SOAP"
target "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP"

\end_inset

, for example, can also do it pretty well.
 REST aficionados sometimes point out that REST is “stateless,” or “session-less
,” both characteristics that would definitely help scale.
 But, this is misleading.
 Protocols might be stateless, but architectures built on top of them don't
 have to be.
 For example, we've specifically talked about sessions here, and many web
 frameworks manage sessions via cookies.
 On the other hand, you can easily make poorly scalable REST.
 The bottom line is that there's nothing in REST that guarantees scalability
 in 
\emph on
this
\emph default
 respect.
 Indeed, engineers coming to REST due to this false lure end up wondering
 what the big deal is.
 We wrote a whole article for 
\bar under
Scaling Tips (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "scaling-tips"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
, which is indeed not specifically about REST.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second use of “scalability” comes from the realm of enterprise and project
 management.
 It's 
\series bold
the ability of your project to grow in complexity without degradation in
 your ability to manage it
\series default
.
 And that's REST's beauty---you already have the infrastructure, which is
 the hardest thing to scale in a project.
 You don't need to deploy client stacks.
 You don't need to create and update proxy objects for five different programmin
g languages used in your enterprise.
 You don't need to deploy incompatible middleware by three different vendors
 and spend weeks trying to force them to play well together.
 Why would engineers care about REST? Precisely because they don't have
 to: they can focus on application engineering, rather than get bogged down
 by infrastructure management.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That said, a “resource-oriented architecture” as we defined here is not
 a bad start for---engineering-wise---scalable systems.
 Keep your extras lightweight, minimize or eliminate shared state, and encapsula
te your resources according to use cases, and you won't, at least immediately,
 create any obstacles to scaling.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Prudence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Convinced? The best way to understand REST is to experiment with it.
 You've come to the right place.

 yourself.
 You'll find it easy, fun, and powerful enough for you to create large-scale

\begin_layout Section
URI-space Architecture
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "uri-space-architecture"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
REST does not standardize URI-spaces, and indeed has little to say about
 URI design.
 However, it does 
\emph on
imply
\emph default
 a preference for certain architectural principles.
 We go over much of the impetus in 
\bar under
The Case for REST article (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "the-cast-for-rest"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
, and suggest you start there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's a good idea to think very carefully about your URI-space: a good design
 will in turn help you define well-encapsulated RESTful resources.
 Below are some topics to consider.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Nouns vs.
 Verbs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's useful to think of URIs as syntactic 
\emph on
nouns
\emph default
, a grammatical counterpart to HTTP's 
\emph on
verbs
\emph default
.
 To put it simply: make sure that you do not include verbs in your URIs.
 Examples:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Good: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/service/{id}/status/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Bad: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/service/{id}/start/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/service/{id}/stop/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What is wrong with verbs in URIs?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One potential problem is clarity.
 Which HTTP verb should be used on a verb URI? Do you need to POST, PUT
 or DELETE to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/service/{id}/stop/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in order to stop the service? Of course, you can support all and document
 this, but it won't be immediately obvious to the user.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A second potential problem is that you need to keep increasing the size
 of your URI-space the more actions of this sort you want to support.
 This means more files, more classes, and generally more code.
 Handling these operations 
\emph on
inside
\emph default
 a single resource would just mean a simple 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

if
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

switch
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 statement and an extra method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A third, more serious potential problem is idempotency.
 The idempotent verbs PUT and DELETE may be optimized by the HTTP infrastructure
 (for example, a smart load balancer) such that requests arrive more than
 once: this is allowed by the very definition of idempotency.
 However, your intended operations 
\emph on
may not be
\emph default
 semantically idempotent.
 For example, if a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

stop
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is sent to an already-stopped service, it may return an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

already stopped
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 500 error.
 In this case, if the infrastructure indeed allows for two 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

stop
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 commands to come through, then the user may get an error even though the
 operation succeeded for the first 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

stop.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 There's an easy way around this: simply allow 
\emph on
only
\emph default
 POST, the non-idempotent verb, for all such operations.
 The infrastructure would never allow more than request to come through
 per POST.
 However, if you enforce the use of POST, you will lose the ability of the
 infrastructure to optimize for non-idempotency.
 POST is the least scalable HTTP verb.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bottom line is that if you standardize on only using nouns for your
 URIs, you will avoid many of these semantic pitfalls.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Also: beware of gerunds!
\emph default
 A URI such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/service/{id}/stopping/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is may be a noun, but allows for some verb-related problems to creep in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Do You Really Need REST?
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "do-you-really-need-rest"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the above section, it was suggested that you prefer nouns to verbs.
 However, this preference may be too constraining for your project.
 Your application may be very command-oriented, such that you will end up
 with a very small set of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

noun
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 URIs that need to support a large amount of commands, meaning less clarity
 and more cluttered code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
REST's best feature it it's tiny set of tightly defined verbs: GET, POST,
 PUT, DELETE.
 The entire infrastructure is highly optimized around them: load balancers,
 caches, browsers, gateways, etc., all know how best to handle each of these
 for maximum scalability and reliability.
 But, it's entirely possible that your needs cannot be easily satisfied
 by just four verbs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And that's OK.
 REST is not always the best solution for APIs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instead, take a look at RPC (Remote Procedure Call) mechanisms.
 The Diligence framework, based on Prudence, provides easy and robust support
 for both 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "JSON-RPC"
target "http://json-rpc.org/"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "XML-RPC"
target "http://www.xmlrpc.com/"

\end_inset

 in its 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "RPC Service"
target "http://threecrickets.com/diligence/manual/service/rest/"

\end_inset

 as well as 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Ext Direct"
target "http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/extdirect"

\end_inset

 in its 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Sencha Integration"
target "http://threecrickets.com/diligence/manual/integration/sencha-ext-direct/"

\end_inset

, allowing you to hook a JavaScript function on the server directly to a
 URI.
 In terms of HTTP, these protocols all use HTTP POST, and do not leverage
 the HTTP infrastructure as well as a more fully RESTful API.
 But, one size does not fit all, and an RPC-based solution may prove a better
 match for your project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's also perfectly possible to use 
\emph on
both
\emph default
 REST and RPC in your project.
 Use each approach where it is most appropriate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Hierarchical URIs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's entirely a matter of convention that the use of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in URIs implies hierarchy.
 Historically, the convention was likely imported from filesystem paths,
 where a name before a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 signifies a directory rather than a file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This convention is useful because it's very familiar to users, but beyond
 that it implies a few semantic properties that can add clarity and power
 to your resource design.
 There are two possible principles you may consider:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A descendant resource 
\emph on
belongs to
\emph default
 its ancestor, such that resources have cascading relationships in the hierarchy.
 This implies two rules:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Operations on a resource 
\emph on
may
\emph default
 affect descendants.
 This rule is most obvious when applied to the DELETE verb: for example,
 if you delete 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/user/{id}/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, then it is expected that the resources at 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/user/{id}/profile/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/user/{id}/preferences/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 also be deleted.
 A PUT, too, would also affect the descendant resources.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Operations on a resource 
\emph on
should not
\emph default
 affect ancestors.
 In other words, a descendant's state is isolated from its ancestors.
 For example, if I send a POST to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/user/{id}/profile/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, the representation at 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/user/{id}/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 should remain unaltered.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
A descendant resource 
\emph on
belongs to
\emph default
 its ancestor and also represents 
\emph on
an aspect of
\emph default
 its ancestor, such that operations on a resource can be fine-tuned to particula
r aspects of it.
 This implies three rules:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Descendant representations 
\emph on
are included
\emph default
 in ancestor representations.
 For example, a GET on 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/service/{id}/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 would include information about the status that you would see if you GET
 on 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/service/{id}/status/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The latter URI makes it easier for the client to direct operations at the
 status aspect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Operations on a resource 
\emph on
may
\emph default
 affect descendants.
 See above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Operations on a resource 
\emph on
will
\emph default
 affect ancestors.
 This is the 
\emph on
opposite 
\emph default
of the above: the descendant's state is 
\emph on
not isolated 
\emph default
from its ancestors.
 For example, a POST to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/service/{id}/status/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 would surely also affect 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/service/{id}/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which includes the status.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
You can see from the difference between rule 1.b and 2.c.
 that it's important to carefully define the 
\emph on
nature
\emph default
 of your hierarchical relationships.
 Unlike filesystem directory hierarchies, in a URI-space there is no single
 standard or obvious interpretation of what of a hierarchical relationship
 would mean.
 But unless you clarify it for yourself, it cannot be clear to your users.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Formats Are Not Aspects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A format should not be considered 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

an aspect
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the sense used in principle 2.
 For example, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/service/{id}/html/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 would not be a good way to support an HTML format for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/service/{id}/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The reason is that you would be allowing for more than one URI for the
 same encapsulated resource, creating confusion for users.
 For example, it's not immediately clear what would happen if they DELETE
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/service/{id}/html/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Would that just remove the ability to represent the service as HTML? Or
 delete the service itself?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Supporting multiple formats is best handled with content negotiation, within
 the REST architecture.
 If further formatting is required, URI query parameters can be used.
 For example: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/service/{id}/?indent=2
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 might return a JSON representation with 2-space indentation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Plural vs.
 Singular
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You'll see RESTful implementations that use either convention.
 The advantage of using the singular form is that you have less addresses,
 and what some people would call a more elegant scheme:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "breaklines=true"
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

/animal/cat/12/ -> Just one cat
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

/animal/cat/ -> All cats
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why add another URL format when a single one is enough to do the work? 
 One reason is that you can help the client avoid potential errors.
 For example, the client probably uses a variable to hold the ID of the
 cat and then constructs the URL dynamically.
 But, what if the client forgets to check for empty IDs? It might then construct
 a URL in the form “/animal/cat//” which would then successfully access
 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 cats.
 This can cause unintended consequences and be difficult to debug.
 If, however, we used this scheme:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "breaklines=true"
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

/animal/cat/12/ -> Just one cat
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

/animal/cats/ -> All cats
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\SpecialChar \ldots{}
then the form “/animal/cat//” would route to our singular cat resource,
 which would indeed not find the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

empty
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 cat and return the expected, debuggable 404 error.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From this example, we can extract a good rule of thumb: 
\emph on
clearly separate URI templates by usage
\emph default
, so that mistakes cannot happen.
 More URI types means more debuggability.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Documenting Your URI-Space
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you create a programming language API, you will surely want to document
 it in a human language.
 You will want to define the acceptable types and usages of function arguments,
 describe return values, possible raises exceptions, add implementation
 and performance notes, etc.
 Many programming languages include tools for embedding such documentation
 as comments in the source code, and generating a reference manual from
 it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Scaling Tips
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Scalability is the ability to respond to a growing number of user requests
 without degradation in response time.
 Two variables influence it: 1) your total number of threads and 2) the
 time it takes each thread to process a request.
 Increasing the number of threads seems straightforward: you can keep adding
 more machines behind load balancers.
 However, the two variables are tied, as there are diminishing returns and
 even reversals: beyond a certain point, time per request can actually grow
 longer as you add threads and machines.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's ignore the first variable here, because the challenge of getting more
 machines is mostly financial.
 It's the second that you can do something about as an engineer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you want your application to handle many concurrent users, then you're
 fighting this fact: a request will get queued in the best case or discarded
 in the worst case if there is no thread available to serve it.
 Your challenge is to make sure that a thread is always available.
 And it's not easy, as you'll find out as you read through this article.
 Minimizing the time per request becomes an architectural challenge that
 encompasses the entire structure of your application
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Performance Does Not Equal Scalability
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Performance does not equal scalability.
 Performance does not equal scalability.
 Performance does not equal scalability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Get it? Performance does not equal scalability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is an important mantra for two reasons:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
1.
 Performant Can Mean Less Scalable
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Optimizing for performance can adversely affect your scalability.
 The reason is contextual: when you optimize for performance, you often
 work in an isolated context, specifically so you can accurately measure
 response times and fine-tune them.
 For example, making sure that a specific SQL query is fast would involve
 just running that query.
 A full-blown experiment involving millions of users doing various operations
 on your application would make it very hard to accurately measure and optimize
 the query.
 Unfortunately, by working in an isolated context you cannot easily see
 how your efforts would affect other parts of an application.
 To do so would require a lot of experience and imagination.
 To continue our example, in order to optimize your one SQL query you might
 create an index.
 That index might need to be synchronized with many servers in your cluster.
 And that synchronization overhead, in turn, could seriously affect your
 ability to scale.
 Congratulations! You've made one query run fast in a situation that never
 happens in real life, and you've brought your web site to a halt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One way to try to get around this is to fake scale.
 Tools such as 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "JMeter"
target "http://jakarta.apache.org/jmeter/"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Siege"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "ApacheBench"
target "http://httpd.apache.org/"

\end_inset

 can create “load.” They also create unfounded confidence in engineers.
 If you simulate 10,000 users bombarding a single web page, then you're,
 as before, working in an isolated context.
 All you've done is add concurrency to your performance optimization measurement
s.
 Your application pathways might work optimally in these situations, but
 this might very well be due to the fact that the system is not doing anything
 else.
 Add those “other” operations in, and you might get worse site capacity
 than you did before “optimizing.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
2.
 Wasted Effort
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even if you don't adversely affect your scalability through optimizing for
 performance, you might be making no gains, either.
 No harm done? Well, plenty of harm, maybe.
 Optimizing for performance might waste a lot of development time and money.
 This effort would be better spent on work that could actually help scalability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And, perhaps more seriously, it demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding
 of the problem field.
 If you don't know what your problems are, you'll never be able to solve
 them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Pitfalls
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Study the problem field carefully.
 Understand the challenges and potential pitfalls.
 You don't have to apply every single scalability strategy up-front, but
 at least make sure you're not making a fatal mistake, such as binding yourself
 strongly to a technology or product with poor scalability.
 A bad decision can mean that when you need to scale up in the future, no
 amount of money and engineering effort would be able to save you before
 you lose customers and tarnish your brand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover, be very careful of blindly applying “successful” strategies used
 and recommended by others to your product.
 What worked for them might not work for you.
 In fact, there's a chance that their strategy doesn't even work for them,
 and they just think it did because of a combination of seemingly unrelated
 factors.
 The realm of web scalability is still young, full of guesswork, intuition
 and magical thinking.
 Even the experts are often making it up as they're going along.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Generally, be very suspicious of products or technologies being touted as
 “faster” than others.
 
\emph on
“Fast” doesn't say anything about the ability to scale.

\emph default
 Is a certain database engine “fast”? That's important for certain applications,
 no doubt.
 But maybe the database is missing important clustering features, such that
 it would be a poor choice for scalable applications.
 Does a certain programming language execute faster than another? That's
 great if you're doing video compression, but speed of execution might not
 have a noticeable effect on scalability.
 Web applications mostly do I/O, not computation.
 The same web application might have very similar performance characteristics
 whether it's written in C++ or PHP.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover, if the faster language is difficult to work with, has poor debugging
 tools, limited integration with web technologies, then it would slow down
 your work and your ability to scale.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Speed of execution can actually help scalability in its financial aspect:
 If your application servers are constantly at maximum CPU load, then a
 faster execution platform would let you cram more web threads into each
 server.
 This could help you reduce costs.
 For example, see 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Facebook's HipHop"
target "http://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/358"

\end_inset

: they saved millions by translating their PHP code to C.
 Because Prudence is built on the fast JVM platform, you're in good hands
 in this respect.
 Note, however, that there's a potential pitfall to high performance: more
 threads per machine would also mean more RAM requirements per machine,
 which also costs money.
 Crunch the numbers and make sure that you're actually saving money by increasin
g performance.
 Once again, performance does not equal scalability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That last point about programming languages is worth some elaboration.
 Beyond how well your chosen technologies perform, it's important to evaluate
 them in terms to how easy they are to manage.
 Large web sites are large projects, involving large teams of people and
 large amounts of money.
 That's difficult enough to coordinate.
 You want the technology to present you with as few extra managerial challenges
 as possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Beware especially of languages and platforms described as “agile,” as if
 they somehow embody the spirit of the popular 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Agile Manifesto"
target "http://agilemanifesto.org/"

\end_inset

.
 Often, “agile” seems to emphasize the following features: forgiveness for
 syntax slips, light or no type checking, automatic memory management and
 automatic concurrency---all features that seem to speed up development,
 but could just as well be used for sloppy, error-prone, hard-to-debug,
 and hard-to-fix code, slowing down development in the long run.
 If you're reading this article, then your goal is likely not to create
 a quick demo, but a stable application with a long, evolving life span.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ignore the buzzwords (“productivity”, “fast”), and instead make sure you're
 choosing technology that you can control, instead of technology that will
 control you.

Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Be especially careful of applying a solution before you know if you even
 have a problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How to identify your scalability bottlenecks? You can create simulations
 and measurements of scalability rather than performance.
 You need to model actual user behavior patterns, allow for a diversity
 of such behaviors to happen concurrently, and replicate this diversity
 on a massive scale.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Creating such a simulation is a difficult and expensive, as is monitoring
 and interpreting the results and identifying potential bottlenecks.
 This is the main reason for the lack of good data and good judgment about
 how to scale.
 Most of what we know comes from tweaking real live web sites, which either
 comes at the expense of user experience, or allows for very limited experimenta
tion.
 Your best bet is to hire a team who's already been through this before.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Optimizing for Scalability
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, your architectural objective is to increase concurrency, not
 necessarily performance.
 Optimizing for concurrency means breaking up tasks into as many pieces
 as possible, and possibly even breaking requests into smaller pieces.
 We'll cover numerous strategies here, from frontend to backend.
 Meanwhile, feel free to frame these inspirational slogans on your wall:

\begin_layout Subsection
Caching
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "scaling-tips-caching"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Retrieving from a cache can be orders of magnitude faster than dynamically
 processing a request.
 It's your most powerful tool for increasing concurrency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Caching, however, is only effective is there's something in the cache.
 It's pointless to cache fragments that appear only to one user on only
 one page that they won't return to.
 On the other hand, there may very well be fragments on the page that will
 recur often.
 If you design your page carefully to allow for fragmentation, you will
 reap the benefits of fine-grained caching.
 Remember, though, that the outermost fragment's expiration defines the
 expiration of the included fragments.
 It's thus good practice to define no caching on the page itself, and only
 to cache fragments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In your plan for fine-grained caching with Prudence, take special care to
 isolate those fragments that cannot be cached, and cache everything around
 them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Make sure to change the 
\bar under
cache key (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "../manual/api/|document-cache-key-pattern"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
 to fit the lowest common denominator: you want as many possible requests
 to use the already-cached data, rather than generating new data.
 Note that, by default, Prudence includes the request URI in the cache key.
 Fragments, though, may very well appear identically in many different URIs.
 You would thus not want the URI as part of their cache key.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cache aggressively, but also take cache validation seriously.
 Make good use of Prudence's 
\bar under
cache tags (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "../manual/api/|document-cache-tags"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
 to allow you to invalidate portions of the cache that should be updated
 as data changes.
 Note, though, that every time you invalidate you will lose caching benefits.
 If possible, make sure that your cache tags don't cover too many pages.
 Invalidate only those entries that really need to be invalidated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(It's sad that many popular web sites do cache validation so poorly.
 Users have come to expect that sometimes they see wrong, outdated data
 on a page, sometimes mixed with up-to-date data.
 The problem is usually solved within minutes, or after a few browser refreshes,
 but please do strive for a better user experience in your web site!)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you're using a 
\bar under
deferred task handler (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "scaling-tips-deferrable-tasks"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
, you might want to invalidate tagged cache entries when tasks are done.
 Consider creating a special internal API that lets the task handler call
 back to your application to do this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How long should you cache? As long as the user can bear! In a perfect world,
 of limitless computing resources, all pages would always be generated freshly
 per request.
 In a great many cases, however, there is no harm at all if users see some
 data that's a few hours or a few days old.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Note that even very small cache durations can make a big difference in applicati
on stability.
 Consider it the maximum throttle for load.
 For example, a huge sudden peak of user load, or even a denial-of-service
 (DOS) attack, might overrun your thread pool.
 However, a cache duration of just 1 second would mean that your page would
 never be generated more than once every second.
 You are instantly protected against a destructive scenario.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Cache Warming
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "scaling-tips-cache-warming"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Caches work best when they are “warm,” meaning that they are full of data
 ready to be retrieved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A “cold” cache is not only useless, but it can also lead indirectly to a
 serious problem.
 If your site has been optimized for a warm cache, starting from cold could
 significantly strain your performance, as your application servers struggle
 to generate all pages and fragments from scratch.
 Users would be getting slow response times until the cache is significantly
 warm.
 Worse, your system could crash under the sudden extra load.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two strategies to deal with cold caches.
 The first is to allow your cache to be persistent, so that if you restart
 the cache system it retains the same warmth it had before.
 This happens automatically with 
\bar under
database-backed caches (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "scaling-tips-cache-backends"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
.
 The second strategy is to deliberately warm up the cache in preparation
 for user requests.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider creating a special external process or processes to do so.
 Here are some tips:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Consider mechanisms to make sure that your warmer does not overload your
 system or take too much bandwidth from actual users.
 The best warmers are adaptive, changing their load according to what the
 servers can handle.
 Otherwise, consider shutting down your site for a certain amount of time
 until the cache is sufficiently warm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If the scope is very large, you will have to pick and choose which pages
 to warm up.
 In Prudence, this is supported via 
\bar under
app.preheat (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "app-preheat"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
.
 You would want to choose only the most popular pages, in which case you
 might need a system to record and measure popularity.
 For example, for a blog, it's not enough just to warm up, say, the last
 two weeks of blog posts, because a blog post from a year ago might be very
 popular at the moment.
 Effective warming would require you to find out how many times certain
 blog posts were hit in the past two weeks.
 It might make sense to embed this auditing ability into the cache backend
 itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Pre-Filling the Cache
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If there are thousands of ways in which users can organize a data view,
 and each of these views is particular to one user, then it may make little
 sense to cache them individually, because individual schemes would hardly
 ever be re-used.
 You'll just be filling up the cache with useless entries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Take a closer look, though:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
It may be that of the thousands of organization schemes only a few are commonly
 used, so it's worth caching the output of just those.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
It could be that these schemes are similar enough to each other that you
 could generate them all in one operation, and save them each separately
 in the cache.
 Even if cache entries will barely be used, if they're cheap to create,
 it still might be worth creating them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This leads us to an important point:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Prudence is a “frontend” platform, in that it does not specify which data
 backend, if at all, you should use.
 Its cache, however, is general purpose, and you can store in it anything
 that you can encode as a string.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's take as a pre-filling example a tree data structure in which branches
 can be visually opened and closed.
 Additionally, according to user permissions different parts of the tree
 may be hidden.
 Sounds too complicated to cache all the view combinations? Well, consider
 that you can trigger, upon any change to the tree data structure, a function
 that loops through all the different iterations of the tree recursively
 and saves a view of each of them to the cache.
 The cache keys can be something like “branch1+.branch2-.branch3+”, with “+”
 signifying “-” whether the branch is visually open or closed.
 You can use similar +'s and -'s for permissions, and create views per permissio
n combinations.
 Later, when users with specific permissions request different views of
 the tree, no problem: all possibilities were already pre-filled.
 You might end up having to generate and cache thousands of views at once,
 but the difference between generating one view and generating thousands
 of views may be quite small, because the majority of that duration is spent
 communicating with the database backend.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If generating thousands of views takes too long for the duration of a single
 request, another option is to generate them on a separate thread.
 Even if it takes a few minutes to generate all the many, many tree views
 combinations, it might be OK in your application for views to be a few
 minutes out-of-date.
 Consider that the scalability benefits can be very significant: you generate
 views only 
\emph on
once 
\emph default
for the entire system, while millions of concurrent users do a simple retrieval
 from the cache.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Caching the Data Backend
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pre-filling the cache can take you very far.
 It is, however, quite complicated to implement, and can be ineffective
 if data changes too frequently or if the cache has to constantly be updated.
 Also, it's hard to scale the pre-filling to 
\emph on
millions 
\emph default
of fragments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we go back to our tree example above, the problem was that it was too
 costly to fetch the entire tree from the database.
 But what if we cache the tree itself? In that case, it would be very quick
 to generate any view of the tree on-demand.
 Instead of caching the view, we'd be caching the data, and achieving the
 same scalability gains.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Easy, right? So why not cache 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 our data structures? The reason is that it's very difficult to do this
 correctly beyond trivial examples.
 Data structures tend to have complex interrelationships (one-to-many, many-to-m
any, foreign keys, recursive tree structures, graphs, etc.) such that a change
 in data at one point of the structure may alter various others in particular
 ways.
 For example, consider a calendar database, and that you're caching individual
 days with all their events.
 Weekly calendar views are then generated on the fly (and quickly) for users
 according to what kinds of events they want to see in their personal calendars.
 What happens if a user adds a recurring event that happens every Monday?
 You'll need to make sure that all Mondays currently cached would be invalidated
, which might mean tagging all these as “monday” using Prudence's cache
 tags.
 This requires a specific caching strategy for a specific application.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By all means, cache your data structures if you can't easily cache your
 output, but be aware of the challenge!

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Cache Backends
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Your cache backend can become a bottleneck to scalability if 1) it can't
 handle the amount of data you are storing, or 2) it can't respond quickly
 enough to cache fetching.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before you start worrying about this, consider that it's a rare problem
 to have.
 Even if you are caching millions of pages and fragments, a simple relational-da
tabase-backed cache, such as Prudence's SqlCache implementations, could
 handle this just fine.
 A key/value table is the most trivial workload for relational databases,
 and it's also easy to 
\bar under
shard (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "scaling-tips-by-section"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
.
 Relational database are usually very good at caching these tables in their
 memory and responding optimally to read requests.
 Prudence even lets you chain caches together to create tiers: an in-process
 memory cache in front of a SQL cache would ensure that many requests don't
 even reach the SQL backend.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
High concurrency can also be handled very well by this solution.
 Despite any limits to the number of concurrent connections you can maintain
 to the database, each request is handled very quickly, and it would require
 
\emph on
very 
\emph default
high loads to saturate.
 The math is straightforward: with a 10ms average retrieval time (very pessimist
ic!) and a maximum of 10 concurrent database connections (again, pessimistic!)
 you can handle 1,000 cache hits per second.
 A real environment would likely provide results orders of magnitude better.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The nice thing about this solution is that it uses the infrastructure you
 already have: the database.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But, what if you need to handle 
\emph on
millions
\emph default
 of cache hits per second? First, let us congratulate you for your global
 popularity.
 Second, there is a simple solution: distributed memory caches.
 Prudence comes with 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Hazelcast"
target "http://www.hazelcast.com/"

\end_inset

 and support for 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "memcached"
target "http://memcached.org/"

\end_inset

, which both offer much better scalability than database backends.
 Because the cache is in memory, you lose the ability to easily persist
 your cache and keep it warm: restarting your cache nodes will effectively
 reset them.
 There are workarounds---for example, parts of the cache can be persisted
 to a second database-backed cache tier---but this is a significant feature
 to lose.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Actually, Hazelcast offers fail-safe, live backups.
 While it's not quite as permanent as a database, it might be good enough
 for your needs.
 And memcached has various plugins that allow for real database persistence,
 though using them would require you to deal with the scalability challenges

You'll see many web frameworks out there that support a distributed memory
 cache (usually memcached) and recommend you use it (“it's fast!” they claim,
 except that it can be slower per request than optimized databases, and
 that anyway performance does not equal scalability).
 We'd urge you to consider that advice carefully: keeping your cache warm
 is a challenge made much easier if you can store it in a persistent backend,
 and database backends can take you very far in scale without adding a new
 infrastructure to your deployment.
 It's good to know, though, that Prudence's support for Hazelcast and memcached
 is there to help you in case you reach the popularity levels of LiveJournal,
 Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, etc.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Client-Side Caching
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Modern web browsers support client-side caching, a feature meant to improve
 the user experience and save bandwidth costs.
 A site that makes good use of client-side caching will appear to work fast
 for users, and will also help to increase your site's popularity index
 with search engines.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Optimizing the user experience is not the topic of this article: our job
 here is to make sure your site doesn't degrade its performance as load
 increases.
 However, client-side caching can indirectly help you scale by reducing
 the number of hits you have to take in order for your application to work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Actually, doing a poor job with client-side caching can help you scale:
 users will hate your site and stop using it---voila, less hits you have
 to deal with.
 OK, that was a joke!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Generally, Prudence handles client-side caching automatically.
 If you cache a page, then headers will be set to ask the client to cache
 for the same length of time.
 By default, conditional mode is used: every time the client tries to view
 a page, it will make a request to make sure that nothing has changed since
 their last request to the page.
 In case nothing has changed, no content is returned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can also turn on “offline caching” mode, in which the client will avoid
 even that quick request.
 Why not enable offline caching by default? Because it involves some risk:
 if you ask to cache a page for one week, but then find out that you have
 a mistake in your application, then users will not see any fix you publish
 until their local cache expires, which can take up to a week! It's important
 that you you understand the implications before using this mode.

)
\bar default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's generally safer to apply offline caching to your static resources,
 such as graphics and other resources.
 A general custom is to ask the client to cache these “forever” (10 years),
 and then, if you need to update a file, you simply create a new one with
 a new URL, and have all your HTML refer to the new version.
 Because clients cache according to URL, their cached for the old version
 will simply not be ignored.

Upstream Caching

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you need to quickly scale a web site that has not been designed for caching,
 a band-aid is available: upstream caches, such as 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Varnish"
target "http://varnish-cache.org/"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href

\end_inset

 and even 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Squid"
target "http://www.squid-cache.org/"

\end_inset

.
 For archaic reasons, these are called “reverse proxy” caches, but they
 really work more like filters.
 According to attributes in the user request (URL, cookies, etc.), they decide
 whether to fetch and send a cached version of the response, or to allow
 the request to continue to your application servers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The crucial use case is archaic, too.
 If you're using an old web framework in which you cannot implement caching
 logic yourself, or cannot plug in to a good cache backend, then these upstream
 caches can do it for you.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They are problematic in two ways:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Decoupling caching logic from your application means losing many features.
 For example, invalidating portions of the cache is difficult if not impossible.
 It's because of upstream caching, indeed, that so many web sites do a poor
 job at showing up-to-date information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Filtering actually implements a kind of partitioning, but one that is vertical
 rather than horizontal.
 In horizontal partitioning, a “switch” decides to send requests to one
 cluster of servers or another.
 Within each cluster, you can control capacity and scale.
 But in vertical partitioning, the “filter” handles requests internally.
 Not only is the “filter” more complex and vulnerable than a “switch” as
 a frontend connector to the world, but you've also complicated your ability
 to control the capacity of the caching layer.
 It's embedded inside your frontend, rather than being another cluster of
 servers.
 We'll delve into

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately, there is a use case relevant for newer web frameworks, too:
 if you've designed your application poorly, and you have many requests
 that could take a long time to complete, then your thread pools could get
 saturated when many users are concurrently making those requests.
 When saturated, you cannot handle even the super-quick cache requests.
 An upstream cache band-aid could, at least, keep serving its cached pages,
 even though your application servers are at full capacity.
 This creates an illusion of scalability: some users will see your web site
 behaving fine, while others will see it hanging.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The real solution would be to re-factor your application so that it does
 not have long requests, guaranteeing that you're never too saturated to
 handle tiny requests.
 Below are tips on how to do this.

\begin_layout Subsection
Dealing with Lengthy Requests

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Deferrable tasks are tasks that can be resolved later, without impeding
 on the user's ability to continue using the application.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the deferrable task is deterministically fast, you can do all processing
 in the request itself.
 If not, you should queue the task on a handling service.
 Prudence's 
\bar under
tasks (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref

\end_inset

)
\bar default
 implementation is a great solution for deferrable tasks, as it lets you
 run tasks on other threads or even distribute them in a 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Hazelcast"
target "http://www.hazelcast.com/"

\end_inset

 cluster.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Deferring tasks does present a challenge to the user experience: What do
 you do if the task fails and the user needs to know about it? One solution
 can be to send a warning email or other kind of message to the user.
 Another solution could be to have your client constantly poll in the background
 (via “AJAX”) to see if there are any error messages, which in turn might
 require you to keep a queue of such error messages per user.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before you decide on deferring a task, think carefully of the user experience:
 for example, users might be constantly refreshing a web page waiting to
 see the results of their operation.
 Perhaps the task you thought you can defer should actually be considered
 necessary (see below)?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Necessary Tasks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Necessary tasks are tasks that must be resolved before the user can continue
 using the application.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the necessary task is deterministically fast, you can do all processing
 in the request itself.
 If not, you should queue the task on a handling service and return a “please
 wait” page to the user.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It would be nice to add a progress bar or some other kind of estimation
 of how long it would take for the task to be done, with a maximum duraton
 set after which the task should be considered to have failed.
 The client would poll until the task status is marked “done,” after which
 they would be redirected back to the application flow.
 Each polling request sent by the client could likely be processed very
 quickly, so this this strategy effectively breaks the task into many small
 requests (“It's better to have many short requests than one long one”).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Prudence's 
\bar under
tasks (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "../manual/tasks/"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
 implementation is a good start for creating such a mechanism: however,
 it would be up to you to create a “please wait” mechanism, as well as a
 way to track the tasks' progress and deal with failure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Implementing such a handling service is not trivial.
 It adds a new component to your architecture, one that also has to be made
 to scale.
 One can also argue that it adversely affects user experience by adding
 overhead, delaying the time it takes for the task to complete.
 The bottom line, though, is you're vastly increasing concurrency and your
 ability to scale.
 And, you're improving the user experience in one respect: they would get
 a feedback on what's going on rather than having their browsers spin, waiting
 for their requests to complete.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
File Uploads
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These are potentially very long requests that you cannot break into smaller
 tasks, because they depend entirely on the client.
 As such, they present a unique challenge to scalability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fortunately, Prudence handles client requests via non-blocking I/O, meaning
 that large file uploads will not hold on to a single thread for the duration
 of the upload.
 See 
\bar under
conversation.form (page 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand pageref
reference "../manual/api/|conversation-form"

\end_inset

)
\bar default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately, many concurrent uploads will still saturate your threads.
 If your application relies on frequent file uploads, you are advised to
 handle such requests on separate Prudence instances, so that uploads won't
 stop your application from handling other web requests.
 You may also consider using a third-party service specializing in file
 storage and web uploads.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Asynchronous Request Processing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having the client poll until a task is completed lets you break up a task
 into multiple requests and increase concurrency.
 Another strategy is to break an 
\emph on
individual request
\emph default
 into pieces.
 While you're processing the request and preparing the response, you can
 free the web thread to handle other requests.
 When you're ready to deliver content, you raise a signal, and the next
 available web thread takes care of sending your response to the client.
 You can continue doing this indefinitely until the response is complete.
 From the client's perspective it's a single request: a web browser, for
 example, would spin until the request was completed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You might be adding some extra time overhead for the thread-switching on
 your end, but the benefits for scalability are obvious: you are increasing
 concurrency by shortening the time you are holding on to web threads.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For web services that deliver heavy content, such as images, video, audio,
 it's absolutely necessary.
 Without it, a single user could tie up a thread for minutes, if not hours.
 You would still get degraded performance if you have more concurrent users
 than you have threads, but at least degradation will be shared among users.
 Without asynchronous processing, each user would tie up one thread, and
 when that finite resource is used up, more users won't be able to access
 your service.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even for lightweight content such as HTML web pages, asynchronous processing
 can be a good tactic for increasing concurrency.
 For example, if you need to fetch data from a backend with non-deterministic
 response time, it's best to free the web thread until you actually have
 content available for the response.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's not a good idea to do this for every page.
 While it's better to have many short requests instead of one long one,
 it's obviously better to have one short request rather than many short
 ones.
 Which web requests are good candidates for asynchronous processing?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Requests for which processing is made of independent operations.
 (They'll likely be required to work in sequence, but if they can be processed
 in parallel, even better!)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Requests that must access backend services with non-deterministic response
 times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And, even for #2, if the service can take a 
\emph on
very
\emph default
 long time to respond, consider that it might be better to queue the task
 on a task handler and give proper feedback to the user.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And so, after this lengthy discussion, it turns out that there aren't that
 many places where asynchronous processing can help you scale.
 Caching is far more useful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As of version 1.1, Prudence has limited support for asynchronous processing,

\bar under

Backend Partitioning
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "scaling-tips-backend-partitioning"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can keep adding more nodes behind a load balancer insofar as each request
 does not have to access shared state.
 Useful web applications, however, are likely data-driven, requiring considerabl
e state.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the challenge in handling web requests is cutting down the length of
 request, then that of backends is the struggle against degraded performance
 as you add new nodes to your database cluster.
 These nodes have to synchronize their state with each other, and that synchroni
zation overhead increases exponentially.
 There's a definite point of diminishing returns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The backend is one place where high-performance hardware can help.
 Ten expensive, powerful machines might be equal in total power to forty
 cheap machines, but they require a quarter of the synchronization overhead,
 giving you more elbow room to scale up.
 Fewer nodes means better scalablity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But CPUs can only take you so far.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Partitioning is as useful to backend scaling as caching is to web request
 scaling.
 Rather than having one big cluster of identical nodes, you would have several
 smaller, independent clusters.
 This lets you add nodes to each cluster without spreading synchronization
 overhead everywhere.
 The more partitions you can create, the better you'll be able to scale.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Partitioning can happen in various components of your application, such
 as application servers, the caching system, task queues, etc.
 However, it is most effective, and most complicated to implement, for databases.
 Our discussion will thus focus on relational (SQL) databases.
 Other systems would likely require simpler subsets of these strategies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Reads vs.
 Writes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This simple partitioning scheme greatly reduces synchronization overhead.
 Read-only servers will never send data to the writable servers.
 Also, knowing that they don't have to handle writes means you can optimize
 their configurations for aggressive caching.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(In fact, some database synchronization systems will only let you create
 this kind of cluster, providing you with one “master” writable node and
 several read-only “slaves.” They force you to partition!)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another nice thing about read/write partitioning is that you can easily
 add it to all the other strategies.
 Any cluster can thus be divided into two.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, for web services that are heavily balanced towards writes, this
 is not an effective strategy.
 For example, if you are implementing an auditing service that is constantly
 being bombarded by incoming data, but is only queried once in a while,
 then an extra read-only node won't help you scale.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that one feature you lose is the ability to have a transaction in which
 a write 
\emph on
might
\emph default
 happen, because a transaction cannot contain both a read-only node and
 a write-only node.
 If you must have atomicity, you will have to do your transaction on the
 writable cluster, or have two transactions: one to lookup and see if you
 need to change the data, and the second to perform the change---while first
 checking again that data didn't change since the previous transaction.
 Too much of this obviously lessens the effectiveness of read/write partitioning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
By Feature
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most obvious and effective partitioning scheme is by feature.
 Your site might offer different kinds of services that are functionally
 independent of each other, even though they are displayed to users as united.
 Behind the scenes, each feature uses a different set of tables.
 The rule of thumb is trivial: if you can put the tables in separate databases,
 then you can put these databases in separate clusters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One concern in feature-based partitioning is that there are a few tables
 that still need to be shared.
 For example, even though the features are separate, they all depend on
 user settings that are stored in one table.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The good news is that it can be cheap to synchronize just this one table
 between all clusters.
 Especially if this table doesn't change often---how often do you get new
 users signing up for your service?---then synchronization overhead will
 be minimal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If your database system doesn't let you synchronize individual tables, then
 you can do it in your code by writing to all clusters at the same time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Partitioning by feature is terrific in that it lets you partition other
 parts of the stack, too.
 For example, you can also use a different set of web servers for each feature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also consider that some features might be candidates for using a

\begin_layout Subsubsection
By Section
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "scaling-tips-by-section"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another kind of partitioning is sometimes called “sharding.” It involves
 splitting up tables into sections that can be placed in different databases.
 Some databases support sharding as part of their synchronization strategy,
 but you can also implement it in your code.
 The great thing about sharding is that it lets you create as many shards
 (and clusters) as you want.
 It's the key to the truly large scale.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately, like partitioning by feature, sharding is not always possible.
 You need to also shard all related tables, so that queries can be self-containe
d within each shard.
 It's thus most appropriate for one-to-many data hierarchies.
 For example, if your application is a blog that supports comments, then
 you put some blogs and their comments on one shard, and others in another
 shard.
 However, if, say, you have a feature where blog posts can refer to other
 arbitrary blog posts, then querying for those would have to cross shard
 boundaries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The best way to see where sharding is possible is to draw a diagram of your
 table relationships.
 Places in the diagram which look like individual trees---trunks spreading
 out into branches and twigs---are good candidates for sharding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How to decide which data goes in which shard?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sometimes the best strategy is arbitrary.
 For example, put all the even-numbered IDs in one shard, and the odd-numbered
 ones in another.
 This allows for straightforward growth because you can just switch it to
 division by three if you want three shards.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another strategy might seem obvious: If you're running a site which shows
 different sets of data to different users, then why not implement it as
 essentially separate sites? For example, a social networking site strictly
 organized around individual cities could have separate database clusters
 per city.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A “region” can be geographical, but also topical.
 For example, a site hosting dance-related discussion forums might have
 one cluster for ballet and one for tango.
 A “region” can also refer to user types.
 For example, your social networking site could be partitioned according
 to age groups.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The only limitation is queries.
 You can still let users access profiles in other regions, but cross-regional
 relational queries won't be possible.
 Depending on what your application does, this could be a reasonable solution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A great side-benefit to geographical partitioning is that you can host your
 servers at data centers within the geographical location, leading to better
 user experiences.
 Regional partitioning is useful even for “NoSQL” databases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Coding Tips for Partitioning
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you organize your code well, it would be very easy to implement partitioning.
 You simply assign different database operations to use different connection
 pools.
 If it's by feature, then you can hard code it for those features.
 If it's sharding, then you add a switch before each operation telling it
 which connection pool to use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "breaklines=true"
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

def get_blogger_profile(user_id):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	connection = blogger_pool.get_connection()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	...

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	connection.close()

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	connection = blog_pools[shard_id].get_connection()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	connection.close()
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately, some programming practices make such an effective, clean
 organization difficult.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some developers prefer to use ORMs (object-relational mappers) rather than
 access the database directly.
 Many ORMs do not easily allow for partitioning, either because they support
 only a single database connection pool, or because they don't allow your
 objects to be easily shared between connections.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, your logic might require you to retrieve an “object” from the
 database, and only then decide if you need to alter it or not.
 If you're doing read/write partitioning, then you obviously want to read
 from the read partition.
 Some ORMs, though, have the object tied so strongly to an internal connection
 object that you can't trivially read it from one connection and save it
 into another.
 You'd either have to read the object initially from the write partition,
 minimizing the usefulness of read/write partitioning, or re-read it from
 the write partition when you realize you need to alter it, causing unnecessary
 overhead.
 (Note that you'll need to do this anyway if you need the write to happen
 in a transaction.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Object oriented design is also problematic in a more general sense.
 The first principle of object orientation is “encapsulation,” putting your
 code and data structure in one place: the class.
 This might make sense for business logic, but, for the purposes of re-factoring
 your data backend for partitioning or other strategies, you really don't
 want the data access code to be spread out among dozens of classes in your
 application.
 You want it all in one place, preferably even one source code file.
 It would let you plug in a whole new data backend strategy by replacing
 this source code file.
 For data-driven web development, you are better off not being too object
 oriented.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even more generally speaking, organizing code together by mechanism or technolog
y, rather than by “object” encapsulation, will let you apply all kinds of
 re-factorizations more easily, especially if you manage to decouple your
 application's data structures from any library-specific data structures.

Relational (SQL) databases such as MySQL were, for decades, the backbone
 of the web.
 They were originally developed as minimal alternatives to enterprise database

 Their modest feature set allowed for better performance, smaller footprints,
 and low investment costs---perfect for web applications.

Graph Databases
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If your relational data structure contains arbitrary-depth relationships
 or many “generic” relationships forced into a relational model, then consider
 using a graph database instead.
 Not only will traversing your data be faster, but also the database structure
 will allow for more efficient performance.
 The implications for scalability can be dramatic.

Social networking applications are often used as examples of graph structures,
 but there are many others: forums with threaded and cross-referenced discussion

Document Databases

\begin_layout Standard
If your data is composed mostly of “documents”---self-contained records
 with few relationships to other documents---then consider a document database.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Document databases allow for straightforward distribution and very fine-grained
 replication, requiring considerably less overhead than relational and graph
 databases.
 Document databases are as scalable as data storage gets: variants are used
 by all the super-massive Internet services.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The cost of this scalability is the loss of your ability to do relational
 queries of your data.
 Instead, you'll be using distributed map/reduce, or rely on an indexing
 service.
 These are powerful tools, but they do not match relational queries in sheer
 flexibility of complex queries.
 Implementing something as simple as a many-to-many connection, the bread-and-bu
tter of relational databases, is non-trivial in document databases.
 Where document databases shine is at listing, sorting and searching through
 very large catalogs of documents.

, contact lists, calendars, photo galleries, dating profiles\SpecialChar \ldots{}
 The list is
 actually quite long, making document databases very attractive for many
 products.
 But, it's important to always be aware of their limitations: for example,
 merely adding social networking capabilities to a dating site would require
 complex relations that might be better handled with a graph database.
 The combination of a document database with a graph database might, in
 fact, be enough to remove any benefit a relational database could bring.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A popular document database is 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "MongoDB"
target "http://www.mongodb.org/"

\end_inset

.
 Though document-based, it has a few basic relational features that might
 be just good enough for your needs.
 Another is 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "CouchDB"
target "http://couchdb.apache.org/"

\end_inset

, which is a truly distributed database.
 With CouchDB it's trivial to replicate and synchronize data with clients'
 desktops or mobile devices, and to distribute it to partners.
 It also supports a REST interface which you can easily access via Prudence's
 document.external.
 And, both MongoDB and CouchDB use JavaScript extensively, making it natural
 to use with Prudence's JavaScript flavor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
We've started a project 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "to better integrate Prudence JavaScript with MongoDB"
target "http://code.google.com/p/mongodb-json/"

\end_inset

.
 It is included in the “Savory JavaScript” edition.

Column Databases
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These can be considered as subsets of document databases.
 The “document,” in this case, is required to have an especially simple,
 one-dimensional structure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This requirement allows optimization for a truly massive scale.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Column databases occupy the “cloud” market niche: they allow companies like
 Google and Amazon to offer cheap database storage and services for third
 parties.
 See Google's 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Datastore"
target "http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/datastore/"

\end_inset

 (based on 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Bigtable"
target "http://labs.google.com/papers/bigtable.html"

\end_inset

) and Amazon's 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "SimpleDB"
target "http://aws.amazon.com/simpledb/"

\end_inset

 (based on 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Dynamo"
target "http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2007/10/amazons_dynamo.html"

\end_inset

; actually, Dynamo is a “key/value” database, which is even more opaque
 than a column database).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Though you can run your own column database via open source projects like
 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Cassandra"
target "http://cassandra.apache.org/"

\end_inset

 (originally developed by/for Facebook), 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "HBase"
target "http://hadoop.apache.org/hbase/"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Redis"
target "http://redis.io/"

\end_inset

, the document databases mentioned above offer richer document structures
 and more features.
 Consider column databases only if you need truly massive scale, or if you
 want to make use of the cheap storage offered by “cloud” vendors.

Best of All Worlds

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, consider that it's very possible to use both SQL and “NoSQL”
 (graph, document, column) databases together for different parts of your
 application.
